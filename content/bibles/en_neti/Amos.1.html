According to a generally accepted dating system, Uzziah was a co-regent with his father Amaziah from 792-767 <sc>b.c.</sc> and ruled independently from 767-740 <sc>b.c</sc>. Jeroboam II was a co-regent with his father Joash from 793-782 <sc>b.c.</sc> and ruled independently from 782-753 <sc>b.c</sc>. Since only Uzziah and Jeroboam are mentioned in the introduction it is likely that Amos&#8217; mission to Israel and the earthquake which followed occurred between 767-753 <sc>b.c</sc>. The introduction validates the genuine character of Amos&#8217; prophetic ministry in at least two ways: (1) Amos was not a native Israelite or a prophet by trade. Rather he was a herdsman in Tekoa, located in Judah. His mere presence in the northern kingdom as a prophet was evidence that he had been called by God (see <ref id="22479-22480">7:14-15</ref>). (2) The mighty earthquake shortly after Amos&#8217; ministry would have been interpreted as an omen or signal of approaching judgment. The clearest references to an earthquake are <ref id="22366">1:1</ref> and <ref id="99999, 99999">9:1, 5</ref>. It is possible that the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hafakh</font>, &#8220;overturn&#8221;) at <ref id="22409-22411, 22400">3:13-15, 4</ref>:<ref id="1-1, 22462">11; 6:11</ref>, and <ref id="99999">8:8</ref> also refers to an earthquake, as might the descriptions at <ref id="22393">2:13</ref> and <ref id="1-1">6:9-10</ref>. Evidence of a powerful earthquake has been correlated with a destruction layer at Hazor and other sites. Its lasting impact is evident by its mention in <ref id="23074">Zech 14:5</ref> and <ref id="11749-11754">2 Chr 26:16-21</ref>. Earthquake imagery appears in later prophets as well (cf. D. N. Freedman and A. Welch, &#8220;Amos&#8217;s Earthquake and Israelite Prophecy,&#8221; <i>Scripture and Other Artifacts</i>, 188-98). On the other hand, some of these verses in Amos could allude to the devastation that would be caused by the imminent military invasion.<br /></span></span>   </span>

The parallel verb (&#8220;withers&#8221;) might favor the first option and have the meaning &#8220;wilt away.&#8221; It is interesting to note, however, that the root appears later in the book in the context of lament (<ref id="22440, 22490, 22492, 22501">5:16; 8:8, 10; 9:5</ref>). Either <ref id="22367">1:2</ref> is a possible wordplay to alert the reader to the death that will accompany the judgment (the option of two roots), or perhaps the translation &#8220;mourns&#8221; is appropriate here as well (cf.

There is debate over its significance in this context. Some relate the &#8220;rebellion&#8221; of the foreign nations to God&#8217;s mandate to Noah (<ref id="211-213">Gen 9:5-7</ref>). This mandate is viewed as a treaty between God and humankind, whereby God holds humans accountable to populate the earth and respect his image as it is revealed in all people. While this option is a possible theological explanation of the message in light of the Old Testament as a whole, nothing in these oracles alludes to that Genesis passage. J. Barton suggests that the prophet is appealing to a common morality shared across the ancient Near East regarding the conduct of war since all of the oracles can be related to activities and atrocities committed in warfare (<i>Amos&#8217;s Oracles against the Nations</i> [SOTSMS], 39-61). The &#8220;transgression&#8221; then would be a violation of what all cultures would take as fundamental human decency. Some argue that the nations cited in Amos 1-2 had been members of the Davidic empire. Their crime would consist of violating the mutual agreements that all should have exhibited toward one another (cf. M. E. Polley, <i>Amos and the Davidic Empire</i>). This interpretation is connected to the notion that Amos envisions a reconstituted Davidic empire for Israel and the world (<ref id="22507-22511">9:11-15</ref>). Ultimately, we can only speculate what lay behind Amos&#8217; thinking. He does not specify the theological foundation of his universal moral vision, but it is clear that Amos believes that all nations are responsible before the Lord for their cruelty toward other human beings. He also assumes that even those who did not know his God would recognize their inhumane treatment of others as inherently wrong. The translation &#8220;crimes&#8221; is general enough to communicate that a standard (whether human or divine) has been breached. For a survey of the possible historical events behind each oracle, see S. M. Paul, <i>Amos</i> (Hermeneia).<br /></span></span>   <span class="t1">make</span> that <span class="w H702" data-lemma="H702">four!</span>–<span class="note"><span class="key">15</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Because of three violations of Damascus, even because of four.&#8221;<br /><b>sn</b> The <i>three&#8230;four</i> style introduces each of the judgment oracles of chaps. 1-2. Based on the use of a similar formula in wisdom literature (see <ref id="17270-17271, 17281-17283">Prov 30:18-19, 29-31</ref>), one expects to find in each case a list of four specific violations. However, only in the eighth oracle (against Israel) does one find the expected fourfold list. Through this adaptation and alteration of the normal pattern the <sc>Lord</sc> indicates that his focus is Israel (he is too bent on judging Israel to dwell very long on her neighbors) and he emphasizes Israel&#8217;s guilt with respect to the other nations. (Israel&#8217;s list fills up before the others&#8217; lists do.) See R. B.

See S. M. Paul, <i>Amos</i> (Hermeneia), 46-47. Another option (2) is to understand the suffix as referring to the particular nation mentioned in the oracle and to translate, &#8220;I will not take him [i.e., that particular nation] back.&#8221; In this case the <sc>Lord</sc> makes it clear that he does not intend to resume treaty relations with the nation in view.

A threshing sledge was made of wooden boards embedded with sharp stones or iron teeth. As the sledge was pulled over the threshing floor the stones or iron teeth would separate the grain from the stalks. See O. Borowski, <i>Agriculture in Iron Age Israel</i>, 64-65. Here the threshing metaphor is used to emphasize how violently and inhumanely the Arameans (the people of Damascus) had treated the people of Gilead (located east of the Jordan River).<br /></span></span>   </span>

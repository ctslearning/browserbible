<h3>The Consequences of Accepting Wisdom or Folly </h3>
<p>
<span class="verse Prov_9_1" data-osis="Prov.9.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="w H2454" data-lemma="H2454">Wisdom</span> has <span class="w H1129" data-lemma="H1129">built</span> her <span class="w H1004" data-lemma="H1004">house;</span> she has <span class="w H2672" data-lemma="H2672">carved out</span> its <span class="w H7651" data-lemma="H7651">seven</span> <span class="w H5982" data-lemma="H5982">pillars</span>.<span class="note"><span class="key">2</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> Wisdom is personified as a wise woman. She has prepared a house and established it on <i>seven pillars</i>. This is a reference to the habitable world (e.g., <ref id="16634">8:31</ref>). For the equation of the house and the world, e.g., <ref id="16632">8:29</ref>; <ref id="13800">Job 38:6</ref>; and <ref id="15577">Psalm 104:5</ref> (also G. Bostr&#246;m, <i>Proverbiastudien</i> [LU&#197;], 1-14). The &#8220;seven pillars&#8221; have been variously interpreted, but since seven is a number for completeness and sacredness, the idea seems to be that wisdom produced a perfect world.<br /></span></span>   </span>

Lichtenstein, &#8220;The Banquet Motif in Keret and in Proverbs 9,&#8221; <i>JANESCU</i> 1 [1968/69]: 19-31). The figures of meat and wine represent the good teaching of wisdom that will be palatable and profitable (implied comparisons). Compare <ref id="18742-18743">Isaiah 55:1-2</ref> and <ref id="26309, 26313">John 6:51, 55</ref> for similar uses of the figures. The idea of mixing wine could refer to the practice of mixing wine with spices or with water (as the LXX text assumes; e.g., <ref id="17075">Prov 23:30</ref>; <ref id="17762">Isa 5:22</ref>). Mixed wine was the most intoxicating; thus, her wisdom is attractive. All the imagery lets the simple know that what wisdom has to offer is marvelous.<br /></span></span>   </span>

In Proverbs the water imagery was introduced earlier in <ref id="16533-16537">5:15-19</ref> as sexual activity with the adulteress, which would seem at the moment more enjoyable than learning wisdom. Likewise bread will be drawn into this analogy in <ref id="17272">30:20</ref>.

This approximates an &#8220;as-if&#8221; motif of wisdom literature: The ones ensnared in folly are as good as in Hell.

The parallelism stresses that those who turn to this way of life are ignorant and doomed. It may signal a literal death lying ahead in the not too distant future, but it is more likely an analogy. The point is that the life of folly, a life of undisciplined, immoral, riotous living, runs counter to God&#8217;s appeal for wisdom and leads to ruin. That is the broad way that leads to destruction.<br /></span></span>    </span>

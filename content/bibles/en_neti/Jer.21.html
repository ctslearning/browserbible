There are two primary points of confusion: 1) the relation of the phrase &#8220;outside the walls,&#8221; and 2) the antecedent of &#8220;them&#8221; in the last clause of the verse that reads in Hebrew: &#8220;I will gather them back into the midst of the city.&#8221; Most take the phrase &#8220;outside the walls&#8221; with &#8220;the Babylonians&#8230;.&#8221; Some take it with &#8220;turn back/bring back&#8221; to mean &#8220;from outside&#8230;.&#8221; However, the preposition &#8220;from&#8221; is part of the idiom for &#8220;outside&#8230;.&#8221; The phrase goes with &#8220;fighting&#8221; as J. Bright (<i>Jeremiah</i> [AB], 215) notes and as NJPS suggests. The antecedent of &#8220;them&#8221; has sometimes been taken mistakenly to refer to the Babylonians. It refers rather to &#8220;the forces at your disposal&#8221; which is literally &#8220;the weapons which are in your hands.&#8221; This latter phrase is a figure involving substitution (called metonymy) as Bright also correctly notes. The whole sentence reads in Hebrew: &#8220;I will bring back the weapons of war which are in your hand with which you are fighting Nebuchadrezzar the King of Babylon and the Chaldeans who are besieging you outside your wall and I will gather them into the midst of the city.&#8221; The sentence has been restructured to better reflect the proper relationships and to make the sentence conform more to contemporary English style.<br /></span></span>   </span>

This text has been treated in two very different ways depending upon how one views the connection of the words &#8220;and to/concerning the household of the King of Judah, &#8216;Hear the word of the <sc>Lord</sc>:&#8230;&#8217;&#8221; with the preceding and following. Some treat the words that follow as a continuation of Jeremiah&#8217;s response to the delegation sent by Zedekiah (cf. <ref id="19444">vv. 3</ref>, 8). Others treat this as introducing a new set of oracles parallel to those in <ref id="19494-19525">23:9-40</ref> which are introduced by the heading &#8220;to/concerning the prophets.&#8221; There are three reasons why this is the more probable connection: (1) the parallelism in expression with <ref id="19494">23:9</ref>; (2) the other introductions in <ref id="19444">vv. 3</ref>, 8 use the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el</font>) instead of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">l&#255;</font>) used here, and they have the formal introduction &#8220;you shall say&#8230;&#8221;; (3) the warning or challenge here would mitigate the judgment pronounced on the king and the city in <ref id="19445-19448">vv. 4-7</ref>. Verses 8-9 are different. They are not a mitigation but an offer of escape for those who surrender. Hence, these words are a title &#8220;Now concerning the royal court.&#8221; (The <i>vav</i> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>] that introduces this is disjunctive = &#8220;Now.&#8221;) However, since the imperative that follows is masculine plural and addressed to the royal house, something needs to be added to introduce it. Hence the translation supplies &#8220;The <sc>Lord</sc> told me to say&#8221; to avoid confusion or mistakenly connecting it with the preceding.<br /></span></span>  to the <span class="w H4428" data-lemma="H4428">royal</span> <span class="w H1004" data-lemma="H1004">court</span><span class="note"><span class="key">24</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;house&#8221; or &#8220;household.&#8221; It is clear from <ref id="19456-19461">22:1-6</ref> that this involved the King, the royal family, and the court officials.<br /></span></span>   of <span class="w H3063" data-lemma="H3063">Judah</span>,  <span class="w H8085" data-lemma="H8085">“Listen</span> to <span class="w H1697" data-lemma="H1697">what</span> the <span class="w H3068" data-lemma="H3068">Lord</span> says, </span>

<span class="verse Jer_21_13" data-osis="Jer.21.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="w H2005" data-lemma="H2005">Listen</span>,  you<span class="note"><span class="key">30</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;Listen, Jerusalem, you&#8230;&#8221;; <i>Heb</i> text of <ref id="99999">v. 21</ref>a-b reads, &#8220;Behold I am against you [fem. sg.], O inhabitant [fem. sg.] of the valley [and of] the rock of the plain, oracle of the <sc>Lord</sc>, who are saying [masc. pl.].&#8221; Verses 13-14 are generally treated as a separate oracle addressed to Jerusalem. The basis for this is (1) the appropriateness of the description here to the city of Jerusalem; (2) the rather similar reference to Jerusalem smugly living in her buildings made from cedars of Lebanon in <ref id="19478">22:23</ref>; (3) the use of the second feminine singular pronoun &#8220;you&#8221; in other places in reference to Jerusalem (cf. clearly in <ref id="19042, 19098, 19287, 19321-19322">4:14; 6:8; 13:20; 15:5-6</ref>); (4) the use of the feminine singular participle to refer to personified Jerusalem in <ref id="19219">10:17</ref> as well as <ref id="99999">20:23</ref>. However, the description in <ref id="19454">21:13</ref> is equally appropriate to the royal household that the <sc>Lord</sc> has been addressing; the palace stood on the Ophel or fill between the northern and southern hill just south of the temple and overlooked the Kidron valley. Moreover, the word &#8220;enthroned&#8221; is even more fitting to the royal household than to Jerusalem. The phrase &#8220;enthroned above the valley&#8221; is literally &#8220;inhabitant of the valley.&#8221; But since the literal is inappropriate for either Jerusalem or the royal palace, the phrase is regularly interpreted after the parallel phrase referring to the <sc>Lord</sc> &#8220;enthroned above the cherubim.&#8221; The royal house was &#8220;enthroned&#8221; more literally than Jerusalem was. Taking this to refer to the royal court rather than Jerusalem also introduces one less unintroduced entity by the shift in pronoun in <ref id="19442-19455">vv. 11-14</ref> as well as eliminating the introduction of an otherwise unintroduced oracle. The &#8220;you&#8221; of &#8220;you boast&#8221; is actually the masculine plural participle (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;who say&#8221;) that modifies the feminine singular participle &#8220;you who sit enthroned&#8221; and goes back to the masculine plural imperatives in <ref id="19453">v. 12</ref> rather than introducing a new entity, the people of the city. The participle &#8220;you who sit enthroned&#8221; is to be interpreted as a collective referring to the royal court not a personification of the city of Jerusalem (cf. GKC 394 &#167;122.<i>s</i> and see, e.g., <ref id="17907">Isa 12:6</ref>; <ref id="22591">Mic 1:11</ref>). Moreover, taking the referent to be the royal court makes the reference to the word translated &#8220;palace&#8221; much more natural. The word is literally &#8220;forest&#8221; and is often seen to be an allusion to the armory which was called the &#8220;Forest of Lebanon&#8221; (<ref id="8937, 9097, 9101">1 Kgs 7:2; 10:17; 10:21</ref>; <ref id="18061">Isa 22:8</ref> and see also <ref id="20829">Ezek 17:3</ref> in an allegory (<ref id="19360-19376">17:2-18</ref>) which may have been contemporary with this oracle). Taking the oracle to refer to the royal court also makes this oracle more parallel with the one that follows where destruction of the palace leads also to the destruction of the city.<br /></span></span>  who <span class="w H3427" data-lemma="H3427">sit enthroned</span> above the <span class="w H6010" data-lemma="H6010">valley</span> on a <span class="w H6697" data-lemma="H6697">rocky</span> <span class="w H4334" data-lemma="H4334">plateau</span>.

They are rendered as negative affirmations for clarity.<br /><br/></br><b>sn</b> What is being expressed here is the belief in the inviolability of Zion/Jerusalem carried to its extreme. Signal deliverances of Jerusalem such as those experienced under Jehoshaphat (2 Chr 20) and Hezekiah (<ref id="18389-18390">Isa 37:36-37</ref>) in the context of promises to protect it (<ref id="18255-18256, 18386-18388, 18397">Isa 31:4-5; 37:33-35; 38:6</ref>) led to a belief that Zion was unconquerable. This belief found expression in several of Israel&#8217;s psalms (Pss 46, 48, 76) and led to the mistaken assumption that God would protect it regardless of how the people treated God or one another. Micah and Jeremiah both deny that (cf. <ref id="22617-22621">Mic 3:8-12</ref>; <ref id="19454-19455">Jer 21:13-14</ref>).<br /></span></span>   </span>

They have regularly been leveled to the same person throughout in the translation to avoid possible confusion for the English reader.<br /></span></span> </span>

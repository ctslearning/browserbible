<h3>Judgment Against Ammon</h3>
<p>
<span class="verse Jer_49_1" data-osis="Jer.49.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>The <span class="w H3068" data-lemma="H3068">Lord</span>  <span class="w H559" data-lemma="H559">spoke</span> about the <span class="w H5983 H1121" data-lemma="H5983 H1121">Ammonites</span>.<span class="note"><span class="key">1</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> <i>Ammonites</i>. Ammon was a small kingdom to the north and east of Moab which was in constant conflict with the Transjordanian tribes of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh over territorial rights to the lands north and south of the Jabbok River. Ammon mainly centered on the city of Rabbah which is modern Amman. According to <ref id="6843">Judg 11:13</ref> the Ammonites claimed the land between the Jabbok and the Arnon but this was land taken from them by Sihon and Og and land that the Israelites captured from the latter two kings. The Ammonites attempted to expand into the territory of Israel in the Transjordan in the time of Jephthah (Judg 10-11) and the time of Saul (1 Sam 11). Apparently when Tiglath Pileser carried away the Israelite tribes in Transjordan in 733 <sc>b.c.</sc>, the Ammonites took over possession of their cities (<ref id="20129">Jer 49:1</ref>). Like Moab they appear to have been loyal to Nebuchadnezzar in the early part of his reign, forming part of the contingent that he sent to harass Judah when Jehoiakim rebelled in 598 <sc>b.c.</sc> (<ref id="10205">2 Kgs 24:2</ref>). But along with Moab and Edom they sent representatives to plot rebellion against Nebuchadnezzar in 594 <sc>b.c.</sc> (<ref id="19600">Jer 27:3</ref>). The Ammonites were evidently in rebellion against him in 588 <sc>b.c.</sc> when he had to decide whether to attack Rabbah or Jerusalem first (<ref id="20963-20968">Ezek 21:18-23</ref> [<ref id="1-1">21:23-28</ref> HT]). They appear to have remained in rebellion after the destruction of Jerusalem because their king Baalis was behind the plot to assassinate Gedaliah and offered refuge to Ishmael after he did it (<ref id="19955, 19973">Jer 40:13; 41:15</ref>). According to the Jewish historian Josephus they were conquered in 582 <sc>b.c.</sc> by Nebuchadnezzar.<br /></span></span>   “Do you think there are <span class="w H369" data-lemma="H369">not</span> any <span class="w H1121" data-lemma="H1121">people of the nation</span> of <span class="w H3478" data-lemma="H3478">Israel</span> remaining?

Why [then] has Malcom taken possession of Gad and [why] do his [Malcom&#8217;s] people live in his [Gad&#8217;s] land?&#8221; A literal translation here will not produce any meaning without major commentary. Hence the meaning that is generally agreed on is reflected in an admittedly paraphrastic translation. The reference is to the fact that the Ammonites had taken possession of the cities that had been deserted when the Assyrians carried off the Transjordanian tribes in 733 <sc>b.c.</sc> assuming that the Israelites would not return in sufficient numbers to regain control of it. The thought underlying the expression &#8220;Why has Milcom taken possession&#8230;&#8221; reflects the idea, common in the OT and the ancient Near East, that the god of a people drove out the previous inhabitants, gave their land to his worshipers to possess, and took up residence with them there (cf., e.g., <ref id="4914">Deut 1:21</ref>; <ref id="6854">Judg 11:24</ref> and line 33-34 of the Moabite stone: &#8220;Chemosh said to me, &#8216;Go down, fight against Hauronen.&#8217; And I went down [and I fought against the town and took it], and Chemosh dwelt there in my time.&#8221; [<i>ANET</i> 321]).<br /></span></span>   </span>

The Hebrew text reads &#8220;run back and forth among the walls.&#8221; The word &#8220;run back and forth&#8221; is generally taken as a Hitpolel of a verb that means to &#8220;go about&#8221; in the Qal and to &#8220;go back and forth&#8221; in the Polel (cf. BDB 1002 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1496;</font>). The noun that follows in the Hebrew means &#8220;wall, hedge&#8221; and is quite commonly modified by the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1465;&#1488;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tso</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">n</font>, &#8220;sheep&#8221;) referring to sheepfolds (cf., e.g., <ref id="4755">Num 32:36</ref>; <ref id="7843">1 Sam 24:3</ref>). But the phrase &#8220;run back and forth among the sheepfolds&#8221; yields little meaning here. In <ref id="15367">Ps 89:40</ref> (<ref id="99999">89:41</ref> HT) the word &#8220;wall&#8221; is used in parallelism with fortified cities and refers to the walls of the city. That is the sense that is assumed in one of the alternate translations with the words &#8220;of your towns&#8221; being supplied in the translation for clarification. However, that figure is a little odd in a context which speaks of mourning rites. Hence, some emend the word &#8220;walls&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1456;&#1491;&#1461;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font>, <font face="Scholar">g&#255;derot</font>) to &#8220;gashes&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1456;&#1491;&#1467;&#1491;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font>, <font face="Scholar">g&#255;dudot</font>), a word that has occurred in a similar context in <ref id="20118">Jer 48:37</ref>. That would involve only the common confusion of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;</font> and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;</font>. That is the reading adopted here and fits the context nicely. NRSV appears to go one step further and read the verb as a Hitpolel from a root that is otherwise used only as a noun to mean &#8220;whip&#8221; or &#8220;scourge.&#8221; NRSV reads &#8220;slash yourselves with whips&#8221; which also makes excellent sense in the context but is not supported by any parallel use of the verb.<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H3588" data-lemma="H3588">For</span> your <span class="w H4428" data-lemma="H4428">god Milcom</span> will <span class="w H1980" data-lemma="H1980">go into</span> <span class="w H1473" data-lemma="H1473">exile</span> <span class="w H3162" data-lemma="H3162">along with</span> his <span class="w H3548" data-lemma="H3548">priests</span> and <span class="w H8269" data-lemma="H8269">officials</span>.<span class="note"><span class="key">10</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> Compare <ref id="20088">Jer 48:7</ref> and the study note there.<br /></span></span>   </span>

The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zav</font>) is either a Qal perfect or Qal participle of a verb meaning flow. It is common in the expression &#8220;a land flowing with milk and honey&#8221; and is also common to refer to the seminal discharge or discharge of blood which makes a man or woman unclean. BDB 264 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;</font> Qal.2 sees it as an abbreviation of the idea of &#8220;flowing with milk and honey&#8221; and sees it as referring to the fertility of Ammon&#8217;s valley. However, there are no other examples of such an ellipsis. Several of the modern English versions and commentaries have taken the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1461;&#1502;&#1462;&#1511;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">emeq</font>) not as a reference to a valley but to the homonym cited in the note on <ref id="20079">47:5</ref> and see the reference here to the flowing away of Ammon&#8217;s strength. That interpretation is followed here. Instead of explaining the plural ending on <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1502;&#1464;&#1511;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">amaqim</font>) as being an enclitic <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mem</font>) as others who follow this interpretation (e.g., J. Bright, <i>Jeremiah</i> [AB], 325), the present translation understands the plural as a plural of amplification (cf. GKC 397-98 &#167;124.<i>e</i> and compare the noun &#8220;might&#8221; in <ref id="18447">Isa 40:26</ref>).<br /></span></span>   you <span class="w H7728" data-lemma="H7728">rebellious</span> people of <span class="w H1323" data-lemma="H1323">Ammon</span>,<span class="note"><span class="key">12</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;apostate daughter.&#8221; This same term is applied to Israel in <ref id="19714">Jer 31:22</ref> but seems inappropriate here to Ammon because she had never been loyal to the <sc>Lord</sc> and could not hence be called &#8220;apostate.&#8221; However, if it is used of the fact that she rebelled against the <sc>Lord</sc>&#8217;s servant, Nebuchadnezzar, it might be appropriate (cf. <ref id="19603, 19605">Jer 27:6, 8</ref>). Hence the term &#8220;rebellious&#8221; is used in the translation to represent it. The word &#8220;daughter&#8221; is again a personification of the land (cf. BDB 123 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1514;</font> 3) and is here translated &#8220;people of Ammon&#8221; to make it easier for the modern reader to identify the referent.<br /></span></span>   who <span class="w H982" data-lemma="H982">trust</span> in your <span class="w H214" data-lemma="H214">riches</span> and say, <span class="w H4310" data-lemma="H4310">‘Who</span> would dare <span class="w H413" data-lemma="H413">to</span> <span class="w H935" data-lemma="H935">attack</span> us?’ </span>

Its borders varied over time but basically Edom lay in the hundred mile strip between the Gulf of Aqaba on the south and the Zered River on the north. It straddled the Arabah leading down from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba, having as its northern neighbors both Judah and Moab. A long history of hostility existed between Israel and Edom, making Edom one of the favorite objects of the prophets&#8217; oracles of judgment (cf., e.g., <ref id="18047-18048, 18309-18319, 18868-18873">Isa 21:11-12; 34:5-15; 63:1-6</ref>; <ref id="22376-22377">Amos 1:11-12</ref>; <ref id="21096-21098, 21346-21360">Ezek 25:12-14; 35:1-15</ref>; Obad 1-16).

<h3>Separation of the Unclean</h3>

<span class="verse Num_5_1" data-osis="Num.5.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Then<span class="note"><span class="key">1</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> The fifth chapter falls into four main parts: separation of the unclean (<ref id="3794-3797">vv. 1-4</ref>), restitution for sin (<ref id="3798-3803">vv. 5-10</ref>), the jealousy ordeal (<ref id="3794-3821">vv. 11-28</ref>), and the summary (<ref id="3802-3824">vv. 29-31</ref>). There is a good deal of literature on the biblical theme of holiness (for which see the notes on Leviticus primarily). But with regard to this chapter, see (with caution), Mary Douglas, <i>Purity and Danger</i>; J. Neusner, <i>The Idea of Purity in Ancient Judaism</i>; and K.

The RSV and the NASB continued the KJV tradition of using &#8220;leper&#8221; and &#8220;leprosy.&#8221; More recent studies have concluded that the Hebrew word is a generic term covering all infectious skin diseases (including leprosy when that actually showed up). True leprosy was known and feared certainly by the time of Amos (ca. 760 <sc>b.c.</sc>). There is evidence that the disease was known in Egypt by 1500 <sc>b.c.</sc> So this term would include that disease in all probability. But in view of the diagnosis and healing described in Leviticus 13 and 14, the term must be broader. The whole basis for the laws of separation may be found in the book of Leviticus. The holiness of the <sc>Lord</sc> who dwelt among his people meant that a high standard was imposed on them for their living arrangements as well as access to the sanctuary. Anything that was corrupted, diseased, dying, or contaminated was simply not compatible with the holiness of God and was therefore excluded. This is not to say that it was treated as sin, or the afflicted as sinners. It simply was revealing &#8211; and safeguarding &#8211; the holiness of the <sc>Lord</sc>. It thus provided a revelation for all time that in the world to come nothing unclean will enter into the heavenly sanctuary. As the Apostle Paul says, we will all be changed from this corruptible body into one that is incorruptible (<ref id="28772">1 Cor 15:53</ref>). So while the laws of purity and holiness were practical for the immediate audience, they have far-reaching implications for theology. The purity <i>regulations</i> have been done away with in Christ &#8211; the problem is dealt with differently in the new covenant. There is no earthly temple, and so the separation laws are not in force. Wisdom would instruct someone with an infectious disease to isolate, however. But just because the procedure is fulfilled in Christ does not mean that believers today are fit for glory just as they are. On the contrary, they must be changed before going into his presence. In like manner the sacrifices have been done away in Christ &#8211; not what they covered. Sin is still sin, even though it is dealt with differently on this side of the cross. But the ritual and the regulations of the old covenant at Sinai have been fulfilled in Christ.<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H3605" data-lemma="H3605">everyone</span> who has a <span class="w H2100" data-lemma="H2100">discharge</span>,<span class="note"><span class="key">4</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> The rules of discharge (Lev 12 and 15) include everything from menstruation to chronic diseases (see G.

The first part, &#8220;bitter water,&#8221; has been thought to mean &#8220;water of contention&#8221; (so NEB), but this is not convincing. It has some support in the versions which read &#8220;contention&#8221; and &#8220;testing,&#8221; no doubt trying to fit the passage better. N. H. Snaith (<i>Leviticus and Numbers</i> [NCB], 129) suggests from an Arabic word that it was designed to cause an abortion &#8211; but that would raise an entirely different question, one of who the father of a child was. And that has not been introduced here. The water was &#8220;bitter&#8221; in view of the consequences it held for her if she was proven to be guilty. That is then enforced by the wordplay with the last word, the Piel participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1512;&#1458;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ham</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ararim</font>). The bitter water, if it convicted her, would pronounce a curse on her. So she was literally holding her life in her hands.<br /><br/></br><b>sn</b> This ancient ritual seems to have functioned like a lie detector test, with all the stress and tension involved. It can be compared to water tests in the pagan world, with the exception that in Israel it was stacked more toward an innocent verdict. It seems to have been a temporary provision, for this is the only place that it appears, and no provision is made for its use later. It may have served as a didactic force, warning more than actually legislating. No provision is made in it for a similar charge to be brought against the man, but in the case of the suspicion of the woman the man would be very hesitant to demand this test given the harshness on false witnessing in Israel. The passage remains a rather strange section of the Law.<br /></span></span>   </span>

<h3>The Provision of Manna</h3>

It is part of the wider section that is the prologue leading up to the covenant at Sinai, a part of which was the obligation of obedience and loyalty (P. W. Ferris, Jr., &#8220;The Manna Narrative of <ref id="1949-1958">Exodus 16:1-10</ref>,&#8221; <i>JETS</i> 18 [1975]: 191-99). The record of the wanderings in the wilderness is selective and not exhaustive. It may have been arranged somewhat topically for instructional reasons. U. Cassuto describes this section of the book as a didactic anthology arranged according to association of both context and language (<i>Exodus</i>, 187). Its themes are: lack of vital necessities, murmuring, proving, and providing. All the wilderness stories reiterate the same motifs. So, later, when Israel arrived in Canaan, they would look back and be reminded that it was Yahweh who brought them all the way, in spite of their rebellions. Because he is their Savior and their Provider, he will demand loyalty from them. In the Manna Narrative there is murmuring over the lack of bread (1-3), the disputation with Moses (4-8), the appearance of the glory and the promise of bread (9-12), the provision (13-22), the instructions for the Sabbath (23-30), and the memorial manna (31-36).<br /></span></span>  <span class="note"><span class="key">2</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The sentence begins with a preterite and <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive, which can be subordinated to the next clause with the preterite and <i>vav</i> consecutive.

Some argue that the manna episode comes after the revelation at Sinai. But it is not necessary to take such a view. God had established the Sabbath in the creation, and if Moses has been expounding the Genesis traditions in his teachings then they would have known about that.<br /></span></span>    </span>

In Numbers we find that the giving of the manna was about 24 months after the Exod 16 time (assuming there was a distinct time for this chapter), that it was after the erection of the tabernacle, that <i>Taberah</i> (the Burning) preceded it (not in Exod 16), that the people were tired of the manna (not that there was no bread to eat) and so God would send the quail, and that there was a severe tragedy over it. In Exod 16 both the manna and the quail are given on the same day, with no mention of quail on the following days. Contemporary scholarship generally assigns the accounts to two different sources because complete reconciliation seems impossible. Even if we argue that Exodus has a thematic arrangement and &#8220;telescopes&#8221; some things to make a point, there will still be difficulties in harmonization. Two considerations must be kept in mind: 1) First, they could be separate events entirely. If this is true, then they should be treated separately as valid accounts of things that appeared or occurred during the period of the wanderings. Similar things need not be the same thing. 2) Secondly, strict chronological order is not always maintained in the Bible narratives, especially if it is a didactic section. Perhaps Exod 16 describes the initiation of the giving of manna as God&#8217;s provision of bread, and therefore placed in the prologue of the covenant, and Num 11 is an account of a mood which developed over a period of time in response to the manna. Num 11 would then be looking back from a different perspective.<br /></span></span>   and in the <span class="w H1242" data-lemma="H1242">morning</span> you will be <span class="w H7646" data-lemma="H7646">satisfied</span><span class="note"><span class="key">31</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The verb means &#8220;to be sated, satisfied&#8221;; in this context it indicates that they would have sufficient bread to eat &#8211; they would be full.<br /></span></span>   with <span class="w H3899" data-lemma="H3899">bread</span>,  so that you may <span class="w H3045" data-lemma="H3045">know</span><span class="note"><span class="key">32</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The form is a Qal perfect with the <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive; it is in sequence with the imperfect tenses before it, and so this is equal to an imperfect nuance.

The word involved says it is thin, flakelike (if an Arabic etymological connection is correct). What is known about it from the Bible in Exodus is that it was a very small flakelike substance, it would melt when the sun got hot, if left over it bred worms and became foul, it could be ground, baked, and boiled, it was abundant enough for the Israelites to gather an omer a day per person, and they gathered it day by day throughout the wilderness sojourn. Num 11 says it was like coriander seed with the appearance of bdellium, it tasted like fresh oil, and it fell with the dew. <ref id="5141">Deut 8:3</ref> says it was unknown to Israel or her ancestors; <ref id="15138">Psalm 78:24</ref> parallels it with grain. Some scholars compare ancient references to honeydew that came from the heavens. F. S. Bodenheimer (&#8220;The Manna of Sinai,&#8221; <i>BA</i> 10 [1947]: 2) says that it was a sudden surprise for the nomadic Israelites because it provided what they desired &#8211; sweetness. He says that it was a product that came from two insects, making the manna a honeydew excretion from plant lice and scale insects. The excretion hardens and drops to the ground as a sticky solid. He notes that some cicadas are called <i>man</i> in Arabic. This view accounts for some of the things in these passages: the right place, the right time, the right description, and a similar taste. But there are major difficulties: Exodus requires a far greater amount, it could breed worms, it could melt away, it could be baked into bread, it could decay and stink. The suggestion is in no way convincing. Bodenheimer argues that &#8220;worms&#8221; could mean &#8220;ants&#8221; that carried them away, but that is contrived &#8211; the text could have said ants. The fact that the Bible calls it &#8220;bread&#8221; creates no problem. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1462;&#1495;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lekhem</font>) is used in a wide range of meanings from bread to all kinds of food including goats (<ref id="6900-6901">Judg 13:15-16</ref>) and honey (<ref id="7533-7537">1 Sam 14:24-28</ref>). Scripture does not say that manna was the only thing that they ate for the duration. But they did eat it throughout the forty years. It simply must refer to some supernatural provision for them in their diet. Modern suggestions may invite comparison and analysis, but they do not satisfy or explain the text.<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H1851" data-lemma="H1851">thin</span> like <span class="w H3713" data-lemma="H3713">frost</span> <span class="w H5921" data-lemma="H5921">on</span> the <span class="w H776" data-lemma="H776">earth</span>.  </span>

B. S. Childs (<i>Exodus</i> [OTL], 274) follows the approach that any connections to words that actually meant &#8220;what?&#8221; are unnecessary, for it is a play on the name (whatever it may have been) and therefore related only by sound to the term being explained. This, however, presumes that a substance was known prior to this account &#8211; a point that Deuteronomy does not seem to allow. S. R. Driver says that it is not known how early the contraction came into use, but that this verse seems to reflect it (<i>Exodus</i>, 149). Probably one must simply accept that in the early Israelite period <i>man</i> meant &#8220;what?&#8221; There seems to be sufficient evidence to support this.

The omer is mentioned only in this passage. (It is different from a &#8220;homer&#8221; [cf. <ref id="21642-21645">Ezek 45:11-14</ref>].) An ephah was a dry measure whose capacity is uncertain: &#8220;Quotations given for the ephah vary from ca. 45 to 20 liters&#8221; (C. Houtman, <i>Exodus</i>, <ref id="1-1">2:340-41</ref>).<br /><br/></br><b>sn</b> The point of this chapter, with all its instructions and reports included, is God&#8217;s miraculous provision of food for his people. This is a display of sovereign power that differs from the display of military power. Once again the story calls for faith, but here it is faith in Yahweh to provide for his people. The provision is also a test to see if they will obey the instructions of God. Deut 8 explains this. The point, then, is that God provides for the needs of his people that they may demonstrate their dependence on him by obeying him. The exposition of this passage must also correlate to John 6. God&#8217;s providing manna from heaven to meet the needs of his people takes on new significance in the application that Jesus makes of the subject to himself. There the requirement is the same &#8211; will they believe and obey? But at the end of the event John explains that they murmured about Jesus.<br /></span></span>    </span>

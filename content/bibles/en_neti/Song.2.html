The LXX translated it with the generic term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#957;&#952;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">anqos,</font> &#8220;flower, blossom&#8221;). Early English translators knew that it referred to some kind of flower but were unsure exactly which type, so they arbitrarily chose &#8220;rose&#8221; because it was a well-known and beautiful flower. In the light of comparative Semitics, modern Hebrew lexicographers have settled on &#8220;asphodel,&#8221; &#8220;meadow-saffron,&#8221; &#8220;narcissus,&#8221; or &#8220;crocus&#8221; (BDB 287 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1458;&#1489;&#1463;&#1510;&#1468;&#1462;&#1500;&#1462;&#1514;</font>; <i>HALOT</i> 287 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1458;&#1489;&#1463;&#1510;&#1468;&#1462;&#1500;&#1462;&#1514;</font>; <i>DCH</i> <ref id="99999">3:153</ref> s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1458;&#1489;&#1463;&#1510;&#1468;&#1462;&#1500;&#1462;&#1514;</font>). The Hebrew term is related to Syriac <i>hamsalaita</i> (&#8220;meadow saffron&#8221;) and Akkadian <i>habasillatu</i> (&#8220;flower-stalk, marsh plant, reed&#8221;). Lexicographers and botanists suggest that the Hebrew term refers to <i>Ashodelos</i> (lily family), <i>Narcissus tazetta</i> (narcissus or daffodil), or <i>Colchicum autumnale</i> (meadow-saffron or crocus). The location of this flower in Sharon suggests that a common wild flower would be more consonant than a rose. The term appears elsewhere only in <ref id="18322">Isa 35:1</ref> where it refers to some kind of desert flower &#8211; erroneously translated &#8220;rose&#8221; (KJV, NJPS) but probably &#8220;crocus&#8221; (NASB, NIV, NJPS margin). Appropriately, the rustic maiden who grew up in the simplicity of rural life compares herself to a simple, common flower of the field (M. H. Pope, <i>Song of Songs</i> [AB], 367).<br /></span></span>   from <span class="w H8289" data-lemma="H8289">Sharon</span>,<span class="note"><span class="key">3</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> Sharon is a low coastal plain stretching south from Mount Carmel. It is well watered due to the Kurkar ridges running parallel to the shore which trapped the water run-off from the Samaritan hills.

Botanists note that among the many different species of the lily family only one grows in Palestine.

To find a cultivated apple tree growing in the forest among other wild trees would be quite unusual; the apple tree would stand out and be a delightful surprise. Like a cultivated apple tree, the Lover was unique and stood out among all other men. In ancient Near Eastern love literature, the apple tree was a common symbol for romantic love and sexual fertility (S. N. Kramer, <i>The</i> <i>Sacred Marriage Rite</i>, 100-101). The &#8220;apple tree&#8221; motif is used in the Song in a similar manner (e.g., <ref id="17558, 17646">Song 2:3; 8:5</ref>). Likewise, the motif of &#8220;apples&#8221; is used as a symbol of fertility (<ref id="22304">Joel 1:12</ref>) and sexual desire (<ref id="17560, 17562, 17564">Song 2:5, 7, 9</ref>).<br /></span></span>   among the <span class="w H6086" data-lemma="H6086">trees</span> of the <span class="w H3293" data-lemma="H3293">forest</span>,  <span class="w H3651" data-lemma="H3651">so</span> is my <span class="w H1730" data-lemma="H1730">beloved</span> <span class="w H996" data-lemma="H996">among</span> the <span class="w H1121" data-lemma="H1121">young men</span>.

The related noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1462;&#1502;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khem&#255;khah</font>) describes objects which are &#8220;delightful, precious, desirable&#8221; (<i>HALOT</i> 325 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1462;&#1502;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font>). Commentators who adopt an erotic view of the extended metaphor in <ref id="17558">2:3</ref> opt for the sexual desire nuance: &#8220;I desired (sexually).&#8221; Those who adopt the less erotic approach favor the more general connotation: &#8220;I took delight in&#8221; or &#8220;I delight in.&#8221;<br /></span></span>   to <span class="w H3427" data-lemma="H3427">sit</span><span class="note"><span class="key">10</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I delighted and I sat down.&#8221; Alternately, &#8220;I sat down with delight&#8230;.&#8221; The verbs <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1463;&#1491;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497; &#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khimmadti v&#255;yashavti</font>, &#8220;I delighted and I sat down&#8221;) form a verbal hendiadys (GKC 386 &#167;120.<i>d</i>): &#8220;I sat down with delight&#8230;&#8221; or &#8220;I delight to sit&#8230;.&#8221; The sequence of a perfect followed by another perfect with <i>vav</i> conjunctive creates the coordination of the complementary verbal idea (first verb) with the idea of the main (second) verb. The main idea is indicated by the second verb; the first verb indicates the manner of action. The first verb functions adverbially while the second verb carries its full verbal sense (see <i>IBHS</i> 653-54 &#167;39.2.5).<br /></span></span>   in his <span class="w H6738" data-lemma="H6738">shade</span>,<span class="note"><span class="key">11</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1461;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsel</font>, &#8220;shade&#8221;) is used figuratively to depict protection and relief. This term is used in OT literally (physical shade from the sun) and figuratively (protection from something) (<i>HALOT</i> 1024-25 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1461;&#1500;</font>): (1) Literal: The physical shade of a tree offers protection from the heat of the midday sun (<ref id="6770">Judg 9:15</ref>; <ref id="20849, 21237, 21243, 21248">Ezek 17:23; 3<ref id="17544">1:6</ref>, 12, 17</ref>; <ref id="22147">Hos 4:13</ref>; <ref id="22575">Jonah 4:6</ref>; <ref id="99999, 13887">Job 7:22; 40:22</ref>). Similar protection from the sun is offered by the shade of a vine (<ref id="15210">Ps 80:11</ref>), root (<ref id="466">Gen 19:8</ref>), mountain (<ref id="6791">Judg 9:36</ref>), rock (<ref id="18262">Isa 32:2</ref>), cloud (<ref id="18124">Isa 25:5</ref>), and hut (<ref id="22574">Jonah 4:5</ref>). (2) Figurative (hypocatastasis): Just as physical shade offers protection from the sun, the Israelite could find &#8220;shade&#8221; (protection) from God or the king (e.g., <ref id="4118">Num 14:9</ref>; <ref id="18220, 18639, 18690">Isa 30:2; 49:2; 51:16</ref>; <ref id="22291">Hos 14:8</ref>; <ref id="14112, 14447, 14771, 14848, 15397, 16087">Pss 17:8; 36:8; 57:2; 63:8; 91:1; 121:5</ref>; <ref id="20441">Lam 4:20</ref>; <ref id="17442">Eccl 7:12</ref>). The association between &#8220;shade&#8221; and &#8220;protection&#8221; is seen in the related Akkadian <i>sillu</i> &#8220;shade, covering, protection&#8221; (<i>AHw</i> <ref id="99999">3:1101</ref>; <i>CAD</i> S:189). The epithets of several Akkadian deities are <i>sillu</i> and <i>sululu</i> (&#8220;Shade, Protector&#8221;). The motif of protection, rest, and relief from the sun seems to be implied by the expression <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">v&#255;yashavti</font>, &#8220;I sat down&#8221;) in <ref id="17558">2:3</ref>b. During the summer months, the temperature often reaches 110-130&#186;F in the Negev. Those who have never personally experienced the heat of the summer sun in the Negev as they performed strenuous physical labor cannot fully appreciate the relief offered by any kind of shade! Previously, the young woman had complained that she had been burned by the sun because she had been forced to labor in the vineyards with no shade to protect her (<ref id="17543-17544">Song 1:5-6</ref>). She had urged him to tell her where she could find relief from the sun during the hot midday hours (<ref id="17545">Song 1:7</ref>). Now she exults that she finally had found relief from the scorching sun under the &#8220;shade&#8221; which he offered to her (<ref id="17558">Song 2:3</ref>). S. C. Glickman writes: &#8220;Whereas before she came to him she worked long hours on the sun (1:6), now she rests under the protective shade he brings. And although formerly she was so exhausted by her work she could not properly care for herself, now she finds time for refreshment with him&#8221; (<i>A Song for Lovers</i>, 40).<br /></span></span>   and his <span class="w H6529" data-lemma="H6529">fruit</span><span class="note"><span class="key">12</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">piryo</font>, &#8220;his fruit&#8221;) is a figure for the young man himself or perhaps his kisses which the young woman delights to &#8220;taste&#8221; (e.g., <ref id="17594, 17612">Song 4:11; 5:13</ref>). It is possible to take the imagery of the young woman tasting his &#8220;fruit&#8221; as kissing. Likewise, the imagery of the gazelles grazing among the lilies is probably a picture of the young man caressing and kissing his beloved (<ref id="17571, 17618">Song 2:16; 6:3</ref>).<br /></span></span>   is <span class="w H4966" data-lemma="H4966">sweet</span><span class="note"><span class="key">13</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1514;&#1493;&#1465;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">matoq</font>, &#8220;sweet&#8221;) is used literally and figuratively. When used literally, it describes pleasant tasting foods, such as honey (<ref id="6924, 6928">Judg 14:14, 18</ref>; <ref id="17093">Prov 24:13</ref>; <ref id="14180">Ps 19:11</ref>) or sweet water (<ref id="4789">Num 33:28</ref>; <ref id="16656">Prov 9:17</ref>).

The nonerotic approach takes the term in its figurative sense: The experience of his love was pleasant.<br /></span></span>   to my <span class="w H2441" data-lemma="H2441">taste</span>.<span class="note"><span class="key">14</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my palate.&#8221; The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1460;&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khikki</font>, &#8220;my palate&#8221;) is used metonymically in reference to the sensation of taste which is associated with a person&#8217;s palate. The idea of &#8220;tasting&#8221; is used as a metaphor in the OT for the experiential knowledge which is acquired through a person&#8217;s relationship with someone (e.g., <ref id="14398">Ps 34:9</ref>). Just as a person would learn whether a fruit was ripe and delicious by tasting it, so a person could learn of the quality of a person&#8217;s character by experiencing it through personal interaction. This extended metaphor compares the delights of his love to (1) the refreshment of sitting in the shade of a tree for refuge from the desert sun, and (2) the delight of tasting a sweet apple &#8211; a fruit that was not indigenous to Palestine.<br /></span></span>   </span>

<h3>The Banquet Hall for the Love-Sick</h3>

However, several medieval Hebrew <sc>mss</sc> vocalize the form as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1458;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1488;&#1467;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">havi</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">uni</font>, Hiphil imperative 2nd person masculine singular with 1st person common singular suffix, &#8220;Bring me!&#8221;). This is also reflected in LXX (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;&#963;&#945;&#947;&#945;&#947;&#949;&#964;&#949; &#956;&#949;</font>, <font face="Greektl">eisagagete me,</font> &#8220;Bring me!&#8221;) and Syriac. This alternate vocalization tradition has several factors that make it a viable option: (1) It respects the consonantal text; (2) It is supported by the LXX and Syriac; (3) It provides a tighter parallelism with the two identical imperatival forms in <ref id="17560">2:5</ref>a (both 2nd person masculine plural imperatives with 1st person common singular suffixes); (4) It provides thematic unity to the entire poetic unit of <ref id="17559-17560">2:4-5</ref>; and (5) It helps make better sense of an enigmatic unit. This approach is strengthened if the MT reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1491;&#1460;&#1490;&#1456;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">v&#255;diglo</font>, &#8220;and his banner&#8221;) is revocalized to the imperative <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1491;&#1460;&#1490;&#1456;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">v&#255;diglu</font>, &#8220;and feed [me]&#8221;) (see translator&#8217;s note below). In this case, the parallelism throughout <ref id="17559-17560">2:4-5</ref> would be very tight. It would feature four parallel imperatives of request, all revolving around the theme of love-sickness: &#8220;Bring me into the banquet hall, feed me with love; sustain me with raisin cakes, refresh me with apples, because I am faint with love.&#8221; The weakness with the revocalization to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1458;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1488;&#1467;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (&#8220;Bring me!&#8221;) is that it demands, due to the dictates of synonymous parallelism, the questionable revocalization of the MT&#8217;s <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1491;&#1460;&#1490;&#1456;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (&#8220;and his banner&#8221;) to the imperative <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1491;&#1460;&#1490;&#1456;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (&#8220;and feed [me]&#8221;).<br /><br/></br><b>tn</b> Alternately, &#8220;Bring me!&#8221;<br /></span></span> <span class="w H413" data-lemma="H413">into</span> the <span class="w H3196" data-lemma="H3196">banquet</span> <span class="w H1004" data-lemma="H1004">hall</span>,<span class="note"><span class="key">16</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;house of wine.&#8221; The expression <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1514; &#1492;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1497;&#1460;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bet hayyayin</font>, lit. &#8220;house of wine&#8221; or &#8220;place of wine&#8221;) refers to a banquet house where wine is drunk or a vineyard where grapes to produce wine are grown (<i>HALOT</i> 409 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1503;</font>). G. L. Carr favors the vineyard view due to the agricultural metaphors in <ref id="17556-17560">2:1-5</ref>.

Five basic views have emerged: (1) &#8220;his banner over me was love.&#8221; BDB relates <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1490;&#1456;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;</font> to the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1456;&#1490;&#1462;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">d&#255;gel</font>, &#8220;standard, banner&#8221;; BDB 186 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1462;&#1490;&#1462;&#1500;</font>) which refers to (a) banners, standards (<ref id="3657, 3661">Num 1:52; 2:2</ref>) and (b) battalion, company of troops, or division of a tribe signaled by a banner or standard (<ref id="3662, 3669, 3676-3677, 3684, 3690, 3693, 4003, 4007, 4011, 4014">Num 2:3, 10, 17-18, 25, 31, 34; 10:14, 18, 22, 25</ref>). Thus, most translations render <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1490;&#1456;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;</font> as &#8220;his banner&#8221; (KJV, NASB, NIV, NJPS). However, the expression &#8220;His banner over me was love&#8221; is enigmatic. (2) &#8220;serve love to me!&#8221; Delitzsch revocalized the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1491;&#1460;&#1490;&#1456;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (&#8220;his banner&#8221;) as an imperative <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1491;&#1460;&#1490;&#1456;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">v&#255;diglu</font>, &#8220;serve [me]&#8221;) from the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1490;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">dagal</font>, &#8220;to serve food&#8221;) which is related to Akkadian <i>dagalu</i> II (&#8220;to serve food&#8221;). Delitzsch renders the passage: &#8220;Bring me into the banquet hall and serve me love&#8230;for I am faint with love.&#8221; This is supported by LXX which reads: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#7984;&#963;&#945;&#947;&#940;&#947;&#949;&#964;&#941; &#956;&#949; &#949;&#7984;&#962; &#959;&#7990;&#954;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#959;&#7986;&#957;&#959;&#965;</font>, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#964;&#940;&#958;&#945;&#964;&#949; &#7952;&#960;</font>&#8217; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#956;&#8050; &#7936;&#947;&#940;&#960;&#951;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">eisagagete me eis oikon tou oinou, taxate ep</font>&#8217; <font face="Greektl">eme agaphn,</font> &#8220;Bring me into the wine house, and set love before me&#8221;). However, R. Gordis points out the difficulties with Delitzsch&#8217;s proposal: (a) The meaning &#8220;serve&#8221; for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1490;&#1463;&#1500;</font> is unparalleled in Hebrew thus, it would create a homonymic <i>hapax legomenon</i>; (b) We would expect the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">li</font>, &#8220;to me&#8221;) rather than <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ala</font>, &#8220;over me&#8221;) after the imperative; and (c) The Akkadian parallel is uncertain. (3) &#8220;its banner above me is love.&#8221; <i>HALOT</i> relates <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1490;&#1456;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;</font> to the Akkadian noun <i>diglu</i> (&#8220;eyesight, view, look, gaze&#8221;) and proposes the nuance &#8220;sign of an inn,&#8221; such as a flag placed over taverns (<i>HALOT</i> 213 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1462;&#1490;&#1462;&#1500;</font>). This approach renders the line: &#8220;He has brought me to the banquet hall, and its banner above me is love.&#8221; (4) &#8220;his look toward me was loving&#8221; = &#8220;he looked at me lovingly.&#8221; Several lexicons relate <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1490;&#1456;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;</font> to the homonymic root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1490;&#1463;&#1500;</font>, &#8220;look, glance&#8221; (e.g., <i>DCH</i> <ref id="99999">2:415</ref> s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1490;&#1463;&#1500;</font>). The Hebrew noun <i>degel</i> II is related to the Akkadian noun <i>diglu</i> &#8220;eyesight, view, look, gaze&#8221; (<i>CAD</i> <ref id="99999">3:21</ref>; <i>AHw</i> <ref id="17552">1:14</ref>).

Those who adopt this approach render the line: &#8220;His glance upon me is love&#8221; (<i>DCH</i> <ref id="99999">2:414</ref>) or &#8220;His look upon me was loving&#8221; (R.

He renders the line: &#8220;His wish regarding me was lovemaking&#8221; or &#8220;His intentions were to make love.&#8221; Pope&#8217;s suggestion has been adopted by several recent commentators (e.g., G.

Scholars regard the &#8220;raisin cakes&#8221; as (1) literal food viewed as an aphrodisiac to &#8220;cure&#8221; her love-sickness; (2) a figurative expression (hypocatastasis) for sexual passion or lovemaking; or (3) double entendre referring to the literal food as an aphrodisiac and her desire for lovemaking.<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H7502" data-lemma="H7502">refresh</span> me with <span class="w H8598" data-lemma="H8598">apples</span>,<span class="note"><span class="key">21</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;apricots.&#8221; The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tappukhim</font>, &#8220;apples,&#8221; from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font>, <font face="Scholar">tappukha</font>) occurs four times in the book (<ref id="17558, 17560, 17637, 17646">Song 2:3, 5; 7:9; 8:5</ref>) and twice outside (<ref id="17118">Prov 25:4</ref>; <ref id="22304">Joel 1:12</ref>). It is usually defined as &#8220;apples&#8221; (BDB 656 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font>); however, some argue for &#8220;apricots&#8221; (FFB 92-93). The Hebrew noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (&#8220;apple&#8221;) is derived from the Hebrew root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nafakh</font>, &#8220;scent, breath&#8221;) which is related to the Arabic root <i>nafahu</i> &#8220;fragrant scent&#8221; (<i>HALOT</i> 708 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1508;&#1495;</font>). Hence, the term refers to a fruit with a fragrant scent. This may explain why the mere scent of this fruit was thought to have medicinal powers in the ancient Near East (G. E. Post, <i>Flora of Syria, Palestine and Sinai</i>, 128). This imagery draws upon two motifs associated with apples. First, apples were viewed as medicinal in ancient Syro-Palestinian customs; the sick were given apples to eat or smell in order to revive them. Similarly, the Mishnah and Talmud refer to apples as a medication like wine and grapes. Second, apples were considered an aphrodisiac in the ancient Near East. Both motifs are combined here because the Beloved is &#8220;love-sick&#8221; and only the embrace of her beloved can cure her, as <ref id="17561">2:6</ref> indicates (T. H. Ratzaby, &#8220;A Motif in Hebrew Love Poetry: In Praise of the Apple,&#8221; <i>Ariel</i> 40 [1976]: 14).<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H3588" data-lemma="H3588">for</span> <span class="w H589" data-lemma="H589">I</span> am <span class="w H2470" data-lemma="H2470">faint</span> with <span class="w H160" data-lemma="H160">love</span>.<span class="note"><span class="key">22</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;sick of love.&#8221; The expression <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1463;&#1514; &#1488;&#1463;&#1492;&#1458;&#1489;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kholat</font> &#8217;<font face="Scholar">ahavah</font>, &#8220;sick of love&#8221;) is an example of the causative use of the genitive construct: &#8220;I am sick because of love,&#8221; that is, &#8220;I am love-sick.&#8221; The expression <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1463;&#1514; &#1488;&#1463;&#1492;&#1458;&#1489;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kholat</font> &#8217;<font face="Scholar">ahavah</font>, &#8220;faint with love&#8221;) is a figure which compares physical or medical illness caused by a physically draining disease to sexual desire which is so intense that a person is so physically drained that they feel as if they could faint.

It is used figuratively as a hyperbolic hypocatastasis for being so consumed with sexual desire that it saps one of his/her physical and emotional strength (BDB 317 s.<ref id="17557">v. 2</ref>). This is commonly referred to as &#8220;love-sickness.&#8221; It was associated with such deep longing for physical and sexual fulfillment that it weighed so heavily upon a person that he/she was physically and emotionally drained (<ref id="8320">2 Sam 13:2</ref>).<br /></span></span>   <span class="t1">The</span> <span class="t1">Double</span> <span class="t1">Refrain:</span> <span class="t1">Embracing</span> <span class="t1">and</span> <span class="t1">Adjuration</span> </span>

For example, one Egyptian love song reads: &#8220;She will make the doctors unnecessary, because she knows my sickness&#8221; (Papyrus Harris <ref id="17594">4:11</ref>). Similarly, &#8220;My salvation is her coming in from outside; when I see her, I will be healthy. When she opens her eye, my body is young; when she speaks, I will be strong.

The verb designates an expression of love by the position or action of one&#8217;s hands (<i>TWOT</i> <ref id="99999">1:259</ref>). The term is probably used here as a euphemism.

Other scholars suggest that the progressive imperfect is used (&#8220;His right hand stimulates me&#8221;). For a striking parallel, see S. N.

Cosmic forces such as the &#8220;heavens and earth&#8221; were often personified to act as witnesses to an oath (e.g., <ref id="5760">Deut 32:1</ref>; <ref id="17657">Isa 1:2</ref>; <ref id="22582, 22650-22651">Mic 1:2; 6:1-2</ref>; <ref id="14671">Ps 50:2</ref>). In this case, the &#8220;witnesses&#8221; are the &#8220;gazelles and stags of the field&#8221; (<ref id="17562, 17577">2:7; 3:5</ref>). These animals were frequently used as symbols of romantic love in the OT (<ref id="16537">Prov 5:19</ref>). And in Egyptian and Mesopotamian love literature and Ugaritic poetry the gazelle was often associated with sexual fertility. For instance, in the following excerpt from a Mesopotamian incantation text the stag is referred to in the context of sexual potency in which a woman urges an ailing male: &#8220;With the love-[making of the mountain goat] six times, with the lovemaking of a stag seven times, with the lovemaking of a partridge twelve times, make love to me! Make love to me because I am young! And the lovemaking of a stag&#8230;Make love to me!&#8221; (R. D.

The first is the Hiphil imperative (&#8220;do not awake/excite&#8230;&#8221;) and the second is the Polel imperative (&#8220;do not awake/start to move&#8230;&#8221;). The Hiphil depicts a causative action (causing love to initially awaken) and the Polel depicts an intensive action (repeated efforts to awaken love or to set love into motion). On the other hand, G. L. Carr (<i>Song of Solomon</i> [TOTC], 94) writes: &#8220;The meaning is not <i>stir up</i>, i.e., a repetition of the same act, but is rather first the act of awakening or <i>summoning</i> something, and then doing what is necessary to <i>sustain</i> the activity already begun, i.e., being so fully awakened that sleep becomes impossible (e.g., <ref id="17601">5:2</ref>).&#8221; The terms <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1464;&#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ta</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">iru</font>, &#8220;arouse&#8221;; Hiphil imperative from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font>) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1506;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">t&#255;</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">or&#255;ru</font>, &#8220;awaken&#8221;; Polel imperative from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font>) are probably figurative expressions (hypocatastasis) rather than literal, because the object does not refer to a person (her lover) but to an emotional state (&#8220;love&#8221;). The Hebrew root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font> has two basic meanings: (1) to wake up and (2) to excite (<i>HALOT</i> 802 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font>). These two nuances are paralleled in the related Semitic roots: Ugaritic <i>`r</i> and <i>`rr</i> &#8220;to be excited&#8221; (<i>UT</i> 19.1849; 19.1926; <i>WUS</i> 2092) and Akkadian <i>eru</i> &#8220;to awake&#8221; (<i>AHw</i> <ref id="99999">1:247</ref>) (<i>HALOT</i> 802 s.v. II). The Hiphil stem has a four-fold range of meanings: (1) to wake up someone/something, (2) to excite, put into motion, start to work, (3) to summons, (4) to disturb (<i>HALOT</i> 802-803 s.v. II). When used literally, the Hiphil describes waking up a sleeper (<ref id="22924">Zech 4:1</ref>) or stirring up a fire (<ref id="22183">Hos 7:4</ref>). When used figuratively, it describes stirring up (<ref id="18667">Isa 50:4</ref>; <ref id="14778, 15746">Pss 57:9; 108:3</ref>) strength (<ref id="22062">Dan 11:25</ref>), anger/wrath (<ref id="15152">Ps 78:38</ref>), jealous/zeal (<ref id="18494">Isa 42:13</ref>), and love/sexual passion (<ref id="17562, 17577, 17645">Song 2:7; 3:5; 8:4</ref>). The Polel stem has a three-fold range of meanings: (1) to awake, start to move, (2) to agitate, disturb, (3) to set in motion (<i>HALOT</i> 802-803 s.v. II). The expression &#8220;arouse or awaken love&#8221; is figurative (hypocatastasis). It draws an implied comparison between the literal action of arousing a person from sleep and stirring him/her up to excited action, with the figurative picture of a lover sexually stirring up, arousing and exciting the sexual passions of his beloved.<br /><br/></br><b>sn</b> What does the expression to &#8220;arouse or awaken love&#8221; mean? There are three major views: (1) to force a love relationship to develop prematurely rather than to allow it to develop naturally; (2) to interfere with the experience of passionate love; or (3) to stir up sexual passion, that is, to become sexually active.

The intended root is debated among the ancient versions (LXX, Aquila, Symmachus, Vulgate, Targum), Hebrew lexicographers (<i>HALOT</i> 273; <i>DCH</i> <ref id="99999">3:117</ref>), and translations: &#8220;singing&#8221; (KJV, NIV, NASB margin, NJPS margin), &#8220;pruning&#8221; (NASB, NJPS).

In keeping with the extended simile in which the Beloved compares him to a gazelle or stag leaping upon the mountains, the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1465;&#1489;</font> may simply denote &#8220;turn oneself around, change direction&#8221; (<i>HALOT</i> 739 s.<ref id="17556">v. 1</ref>). Rather than leaping somewhere else, so to speak, she invites him to leap upon the &#8220;mountain gorges.&#8221;<br /></span></span>   my <span class="w H1730" data-lemma="H1730">beloved</span>–  be <span class="w H1819" data-lemma="H1819">like</span> a <span class="w H6643" data-lemma="H6643">gazelle</span> <span class="w H176" data-lemma="H176">or</span> a <span class="w H6082" data-lemma="H6082">young</span> <span class="w H354" data-lemma="H354">stag</span> <span class="w H5921" data-lemma="H5921">on</span> the <span class="w H2022" data-lemma="H2022">mountain</span> <span class="w H1335" data-lemma="H1335">gorges</span>.<span class="note"><span class="key">45</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The expression <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1461;&#1497; &#1489;&#1464;&#1514;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hare bater</font>, &#8220;mountains of Bethar&#8221;) is difficult because there is no known mountain-range which was ever called by this name. The meaning of the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1514;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">beter</font>) is uncertain. <i>DCH</i> distinguishes between three homonymic nouns: (1) <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1514;&#1462;&#1512;</font> I noun &#8220;part, piece&#8221; (<ref id="371">Gen 15:10</ref>; <ref id="19821">Jer 34:19</ref>) related to the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1514;&#1462;&#1512;</font> &#8220;to cut in two&#8221; (<ref id="371">Gen 15:10</ref>); (2) <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1514;&#1462;&#1512;</font> II noun &#8220;gorge&#8221; (<ref id="17572">Song 2:17</ref>); and (3) <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1514;&#1462;&#1512;</font> III place name &#8220;Bether&#8221; in Judah and 6.5 miles (11 km) SW of Jerusalem (<ref id="6262">Josh 15:59</ref>; <ref id="10499">1 Chr 6:44</ref>; perhaps <ref id="17572">Song 2:17</ref>) (<i>DCH</i> <ref id="99999">2:291</ref> s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1514;&#1462;&#1512;</font>). Thus, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1461;&#1497; &#1489;&#1464;&#1514;&#1462;&#1512;</font> might mean &#8220;mountains of gorge[s]&#8221; or &#8220;mountains of Bether&#8221; (<i>DCH</i> <ref id="99999">2:291</ref> s.v. III). The Hebrew root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">batar</font>, &#8220;cut in pieces, cut in half&#8221;) is related to Arabic <i>batara</i> &#8220;to cut off&#8221; (<i>HALOT</i> 167 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1514;&#1512;</font>; BDB 144 <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1512;</font>). The word does not appear in Ugaritic, Akkadian, or Syriac. Aramaic <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1514;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ba</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">tar</font>, &#8220;after, behind&#8221;) was used frequently in Northwest Semitic (<i>DISO</i> 45-46) and Late Hebrew (Jastrow 201 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1514;&#1463;&#1512;</font>); however, it offers little to this problem. Many scholars take <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1514;&#1462;&#1512;</font> as a genitive of description functioning as an attributive adjective. For example, BDB suggests that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1514;&#1462;&#1512;</font> means &#8220;mountains of cutting,&#8221; that is, &#8220;cleft mountains&#8221; (BDB 144 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1514;&#1462;&#1512;</font>), while Koehler posits &#8220;ravine,&#8221; that is, mountains with a ravine (<i>HALOT</i> 167 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1514;&#1462;&#1512;</font>). This is reflected in the LXX&#8217;s <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#959;&#953;&#955;&#969;&#956;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">koilwmatwn,</font> &#8220;hollow places, basin, cavity&#8221;): <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8004;&#961;&#951; &#954;&#959;&#953;&#955;&#969;&#956;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">orh koilwmatwn</font>) &#8220;mountains with many ravines.&#8221; This approach is adopted by several translations, e.g., &#8220;rugged mountains&#8221; (NLT). On the other hand, Vulgate, Aquila, and Symmachus took it as a place name referring to the town of Bether (LXX <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#914;&#945;&#953;&#952;&#951;&#961;</font> = Mishnaic Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1512;</font>) located 6.5 miles (11 km) southwest of Jerusalem (<ref id="6262">Josh 15:59</ref>; <ref id="10499">1 Chr 6:44</ref>). This approach is adopted by several translations: &#8220;mountains of Bether&#8221; (KJV, ASV, RSV, NASB, NIV margin, TEV). Theodotion takes it as a figurative expression, reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#952;&#965;&#956;&#953;&#945;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#969;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">qumiamatwn,</font> &#8220;incense&#8221;) which reflects a variant Hebrew reading of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1513;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">b&#255;shamim</font>, &#8220;balsam, perfume&#8221;) which also appears in <ref id="17655">Song 8:14</ref>. This approach is taken in a Jewish-English translation: &#8220;hills of spice&#8221; (NJPS). The botanist L&#246;w connects Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1514;&#1462;&#1512;</font> to Greek <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#945;&#955;&#945;&#946;&#940;&#952;&#961;&#959;&#957;</font> (<font face="Greektl">malabaqron</font>) which was an Indian spice plant imported to Judah. See I. Low, <i>Die Flora der Juden</i>, <ref id="1-1">2:117-118</ref>. The expression &#8220;cleft mountains&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1461;&#1497; &#1489;&#1464;&#1514;&#1462;&#1512;</font>) might refer simply to a rugged and jagged mountain-range (NLT &#8220;rugged mountains&#8221;; NIV &#8220;rugged hills&#8221;). However, this may be a figurative description of the woman&#8217;s cleavage because similar imagery is used in <ref id="17589">Song 4:6</ref> to describe her breasts. The name &#8220;Tihamah&#8221; (literally &#8220;the Great Deep&#8221;) was applied to the low-lying coastland between the mountains of Yemen and the Red Sea as well as to the depression of Djauf (Dumah) because of fresh-water springs which oozed up from below (Hebrew &#8220;Tehom&#8221; and &#8220;Tehomot,&#8221; Ugaritic &#8220;Tihamaten&#8221; or &#8220;Tahamatum,&#8221; Akkadian &#8220;Tiamat&#8221;). And it appears that in an Ammonite inscription that an area near the mountainous region of Rabbath-Amman is referred to by the name &#8220;Tymtn&#8221; (literally &#8220;The Two Depressions&#8221;), rather than by its real name (W. F. Albright, &#8220;Some Comments on the Amman Citadel Inscription,&#8221; <i>BASOR</i> 198 [April 1978]: 38-39).<br /><br/></br><b>sn</b> Scholars offer three interpretations of her figurative request: (1) The Beloved desires her Lover to embrace her breasts, like a gazelle romping over mountains (mountains are figurative); (2) The Beloved entreats her Lover to leave and go back over the hills from whence he had journeyed (mountains are literal); and (3) As her Lover prepares to leave her country village, the Beloved asks him to return to her again in the same way he arrived, like a gazelle bounding over the mountains in <ref id="17563-17565">2:8-10</ref> (mountains are literal).<br /></span></span>    </span>

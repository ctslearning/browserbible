This same introductory formula has occurred in <ref id="19121, 19228, 19386, 19442, 19669, 19733">7:1; 11:1; 18:1; 21:1; 30:1; 32:1</ref> but without such a long introductory phrase.

Some of the nature of the make-up of these forces may be seen from a reference to Babylonian, Aramean, Moabite, and Ammonite raiders in the earlier attacks on Jerusalem during the reign of Jehoiakim (<ref id="10205">2 Kgs 24:2</ref>).<br /><br/></br><b>sn</b> It is difficult to assign dates to passages which have no dating formulas but there is sufficient detail in this passage to show that this incident occurred sometime early in the siege of Jerusalem while Jeremiah was still free to come and go (see <ref id="19804">v. 2</ref> and compare <ref id="19879">37:4</ref> and see the second study note on <ref id="19734">32:2</ref>). The Babylonian forces blockaded Jerusalem and attacked the outlying cities, reducing them one by one until Jerusalem had no further help. According to <ref id="19809">v. 7</ref> Azekah and Lachish in the western foothills still held out and there is evidence from some of the correspondence from Lachish at this period that help was being sought from Egypt.<br /></span></span>    </span>

More details about this covenant are given in <ref id="19817">vv. 15</ref>, 18-19 where it is said to have been made before the <sc>Lord</sc> in the temple and involved passing between the pieces of a cut-up calf.

The terms of their servitude were strictly regulated under Hebrew law (cf. <ref id="2080-2089">Exod 21:2-11</ref>; <ref id="3509-3525">Lev 25:39-55</ref>; <ref id="5332-5338">Deut 15:12-18</ref>). In brief, no Hebrew was to serve a fellow Hebrew for any longer than six years. In the seventh year he or she was to go free. The period could even be shortened if the year of jubilee intervened since all debts were to be canceled, freedom restored, and indentured property returned in that year. Some see the covenant here coming in conjunction with such a jubilee year since it involved the freedom of all slaves regardless of how long they had served. Others see this covenant as paralleling an old Babylonian practice of a king declaring liberty for slaves and canceling all debts generally at the beginning of his reign (but also at other significant times within it) in order to ingratiate himself with his subjects.<br /></span></span>    </span>

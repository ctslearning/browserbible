<h3>The Birth of the Deliverer</h3>
<p>
<span class="verse Exod_2_1" data-osis="Exod.2.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>A<span class="note"><span class="key">1</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> The chapter records the exceptional survival of Moses under the decree of death by Pharaoh (<ref id="1556-1565">vv. 1-10</ref>), the flight of Moses from Pharaoh after killing the Egyptian (<ref id="1556-1570">vv. 11-15</ref>), the marriage of Moses (<ref id="1561-1577">vv. 16-22</ref>), and finally a note about the <sc>Lord</sc>&#8217;s hearing the sighing of the people in bondage (<ref id="1558-1580">vv. 23-25</ref>). The first part is the birth. The Bible has several stories about miraculous or special births and deliverances of those destined to lead Israel. Their impact is essentially to authenticate the individual&#8217;s ministry. If the person&#8217;s beginning was providentially provided and protected by the <sc>Lord</sc>, then the mission must be of divine origin too. In this chapter the plot works around the decree for the death of the children &#8211; a decree undone by the women. The second part of the chapter records Moses&#8217; flight and marriage. Having introduced the deliverer Moses in such an auspicious way, the chapter then records how this deliverer acted presumptuously and had to flee for his life. Any deliverance God desired had to be supernatural, as the chapter&#8217;s final note about answering prayer shows.<br /></span></span> <span class="w H376" data-lemma="H376">man</span> from the <span class="w H1004" data-lemma="H1004">household</span><span class="note"><span class="key">2</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;house.&#8221; In other words, the tribe of Levi.<br /></span></span>   of <span class="w H3878" data-lemma="H3878">Levi</span> <span class="w H3947" data-lemma="H3947">married</span><span class="note"><span class="key">3</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;went and took&#8221;; NASB &#8220;went and married.&#8221;<br /></span></span>   a <span class="w H1323" data-lemma="H1323">woman who was a descendant</span> of <span class="w H3878" data-lemma="H3878">Levi</span>.<span class="note"><span class="key">4</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a daughter of Levi.&#8221; The word &#8220;daughter&#8221; is used in the sense of &#8220;descendant&#8221; and connects the new account with Pharaoh&#8217;s command in <ref id="1555">1:22</ref>.

The marriage, the birth, the hiding of the child, and the positioning of Miriam, are all faith operations that ignore the decree of Pharaoh or work around it to preserve the life of the child.<br /></span></span>   </span>

See R. F. Johnson, <i>IDB</i> <ref id="1-1">3:440-50</ref>; for the text see L. W. King, <i>Chronicles concerning Early Babylonian Kings</i>, <ref id="1-1">2:87-90</ref>. Those who see the narrative using the Sargon story&#8217;s pattern would be saying that the account presents Moses in imagery common to the ancient world&#8217;s expectations of extraordinary achievement and deliverance. In the Sargon story the infant&#8217;s mother set him adrift in a basket in a river; he was loved by the gods and destined for greatness. Saying Israel used this to invent the account in Exodus would undermine its reliability. But there are other difficulties with the Sargon comparison, not the least of which is the fact that the meaning and function of the Sargon story are unclear. Second, there is no outside threat to the child Sargon. The account simply shows how a child was exposed, rescued, nurtured, and became king (see B. S. Childs, <i>Exodus</i> [OTL], 8-12). Third, other details do not fit: Moses&#8217; father is known, Sargon&#8217;s is not; Moses is never abandoned, since he is never out of the care of his parents, and the finder is a princess and not a goddess. Moreover, without knowing the precise function and meaning of the Sargon story, it is almost impossible to explain its use as a pattern for the biblical account. By itself, the idea of a mother putting a child by the river if she wants him to be found would have been fairly sensible, for that is where the women of the town would be washing their clothes or bathing. If someone wanted to be sure the infant was discovered by a sympathetic woman, there would be no better setting (see R. A. Cole, <i>Exodus</i> [TOTC], 57). While there need not be a special genre of storytelling here, it is possible that Exodus 2 might have drawn on some of the motifs and forms of the other account to describe the actual event in the sparing of Moses &#8211; if they knew of it. If so it would show that Moses was cast in the form of the greats of the past.<br /></span></span>   </span>

Here is part of the irony of the passage: What was perceived by many to be a womanly weakness &#8211; compassion for a baby &#8211; is a strong enough emotion to prompt the woman to defy the orders of Pharaoh. The ruler had thought sparing women was safe, but the midwives, the Hebrew mother, the daughter of Pharaoh, and Miriam, all work together to spare one child &#8211; Moses (cf. <ref id="28391-28393">1 Cor 1:27-29</ref>).<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H5921" data-lemma="H5921">for</span> him and <span class="w H559" data-lemma="H559">said</span>,  <span class="w H2088" data-lemma="H2088">“This</span> is one of the <span class="w H5680" data-lemma="H5680">Hebrews’</span> <span class="w H3206" data-lemma="H3206">children</span>.”  </span>

The proximity of the royal residences to the Israelites makes this and the plague narratives all the more realistic. Such direct contact would have been unlikely if Moses had had to travel up the Nile to meet with Pharaoh. In the Delta area things were closer. Here all the people would have had access to the tributaries of the Nile near where the royal family came, but the royal family probably had pavilions and hunting lodges in the area. See also N.

But commentators have found it a little difficult that the explanation of the name by the daughter of Pharaoh is in Hebrew when the whole background is Egyptian (U. Cassuto, <i>Exodus</i>, 20). Moreover, the Hebrew spelling of the name is the form of the active participle (&#8220;the one who draws out&#8221;); to be a precise description it should have been spelled <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mashuy</font>), the passive participle (&#8220;the one drawn out&#8221;). The etymology is not precise; rather, it is a wordplay (called paronomasia). Either the narrator merely attributed words to her (which is unlikely outside of fiction), or the Hebrew account simply translated what she had said into Hebrew, finding a Hebrew verb with the same sounds as the name. Such wordplays on names (also popular etymology) are common in the Bible. Most agree that the name is an Egyptian name. Josephus attempted to connect the biblical etymology with the name in Greek, <i>Mouses</i>, stating that <i>Mo</i> is Egyptian for water, and <i>uses</i> means those rescued from it (<i>Ant.</i> 2.9.6 [2.228]; see also J. Gwyn Griffiths, &#8220;The Egyptian Derivation of the Name Moses,&#8221; <i>JNES</i> 12 [1953]: 225). But the solution to the name is not to be derived from the Greek rendering. Due to the estimation Egyptians had of the Nile, the princess would have thought of the child from the river as a supernatural provision. The Egyptian hieroglyphic <font face="Scholar">ms</font> can be the noun &#8220;child&#8221; or the perfective verb &#8220;be born.&#8221; This was often connected with divine elements for names: Ptah-mose, &#8220;Ptah is born.&#8221; Also the name Rameses (<font face="Scholar">R</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">-m-sw</font>) means &#8220;[the god] Re&#8217; is he who has born him.&#8221; If the name Moses is Egyptian, there are some philological difficulties (see the above article for their treatment). The significance of all this is that when the child was named by the princess, an Egyptian word related to <font face="Scholar">ms</font> was used, meaning something like &#8220;child&#8221; or &#8220;born.&#8221; The name might have even been longer, perhaps having a theophoric element (divine name) with it &#8211; &#8220;child of [some god].&#8221; The name&#8217;s motivation came from the fact that she drew him from the Nile, the source of life in Egypt. But the sound of the name recalled for the Hebrews the verb &#8220;to draw out&#8221; in their own language. Translating the words of the princess into Hebrew allowed for the effective wordplay to capture the significance of the story in the sound of the name. The implication for the Israelites is something to this effect: &#8220;You called him &#8216;born one&#8217; in your language and after your custom, but in our language that name means &#8216;drawing out&#8217; &#8211; which is what was to become of him. You drew him out of the water, but he would draw us out of Egypt through the water.&#8221; So the circumstances of the story show Moses to be a man of destiny, and this naming episode summarizes how divine providence was at work in Israel. To the Israelites the name forever commemorated the portent of this event in the early life of the great deliverer (see <ref id="18878">Isa 63:11</ref>).<br /></span></span>   </span>

<h3>The Presumption of the Deliverer</h3>

Chapter 2 first told how God providentially provided the deliverer, but now when this deliverer attempted to deliver one of his people, it turned out badly, and he had to flee for his life. This section makes an interesting study in the presumption of the leader, what Christian expositors would rightly describe as trying to do God&#8217;s work by the flesh. The section has two parts to it: the flight from Egypt over the failed attempt to deliver (<ref id="1556-1570">vv. 11-15</ref>), and Moses&#8217; introduction to life as the deliverer in Midian (<ref id="1561-1577">vv. 16-22</ref>).<br /></span></span> <span class="w H1992" data-lemma="H1992">those</span>  <span class="w H3117" data-lemma="H3117">days</span>,<span class="note"><span class="key">37</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> The expression &#8220;those days&#8221; refers to the days of bondage.<br /></span></span>   when<span class="note"><span class="key">38</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The preterite with the <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive is here subordinated to the next and main idea of the verse.

Moses seems to have settled into a domestic life with his new wife and his father-in-law. But when the first son is born, he named him <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1461;&#1512;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ger&#255;shom</font>). There is little information available about what the name by itself might have meant. If it is linked to the verb &#8220;drive away&#8221; used earlier (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;</font>, <font face="Scholar">garash</font>), then the final <font face="Scholar">mem</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;</font>) would have to be explained as an enclitic <font face="Scholar">mem</font>. It seems most likely that that verb was used in the narrative to make a secondary wordplay on the name. The primary explanation is the popular etymology supplied by Moses himself. He links the name to the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gur</font>, &#8220;to sojourn, to live as an alien&#8221;). He then adds that he was a sojourner (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1461;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ger</font>, the participle) in a foreign land. The word &#8220;foreign&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1499;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">nokhriyyah</font>) adds to the idea of his being a resident alien. The final syllable in the name would then be connected to the adverb &#8220;there&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">sham</font>). Thus, the name is given the significance in the story of &#8220;sojourner there&#8221; or &#8220;alien there.&#8221; He no doubt knew that this was not the actual meaning of the name; the name itself had already been introduced into the family of Levi (<ref id="10456, 10471">1 Chr 6:1, 16</ref>). He chose the name because its sounds reflected his sentiment at that time. But to what was Moses referring? In view of naming customs among the Semites, he was most likely referring to Midian as the foreign land. If Egypt had been the strange land, and he had now found his place, he would not have given the lad such a name. Personal names reflect the present or recent experiences, or the hope for the future. So this naming is a clear expression by Moses that he knows he is not where he is supposed to be. That this is what he meant is supported in the NT by Stephen (<ref id="27146">Acts 7:29</ref>). So the choice of the name, the explanation of it, and the wordplay before it, all serve to stress the point that Moses had been driven away from his proper place of service.<br /></span></span>    </span>

<span class="verse Exod_2_23" data-osis="Exod.2.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="w H1961" data-lemma="H1961">During</span><span class="note"><span class="key">87</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> The next section of the book is often referred to as the &#8220;Call of Moses,&#8221; and that is certainly true. But it is much more than that. It is the divine preparation of the servant of God, a servant who already knew what his destiny was. In this section Moses is shown how his destiny will be accomplished. It will be accomplished because the divine presence will guarantee the power, and the promise of that presence comes with the important &#8220;I AM&#8221; revelation. The message that comes through in this, and other &#8220;I will be with you&#8221; passages, is that when the promise of God&#8217;s presence is correctly appropriated by faith, the servant of God can begin to build confidence for the task that lies ahead. It will no longer be, &#8220;Who am I that I should go?&#8221; but &#8220;I AM with you&#8221; that matters. The first little section, <ref id="1578-1580">2:23-25</ref>, serves as a transition and introduction, for it records the <sc>Lord</sc>&#8217;s response to Israel in her affliction. The second part is the revelation to Moses at the burning bush (<ref id="1581-1590">3:1-10</ref>), which is one of the most significant theological sections in the Torah. Finally, the record of Moses&#8217; response to the call with his objections (<ref id="1591-1602">3:11-22</ref>), makes up the third part, and in a way, is a transition to the next section, where God supplies proof of his power.<br /></span></span>  <span class="note"><span class="key">88</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The verse begins with the temporal indicator &#8220;And it was&#8221; (cf.

The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shama</font>&#8217;, &#8220;to hear&#8221;) ordinarily includes responding to what is heard. It can even be found in idiomatic constructions meaning &#8220;to obey.&#8221; To say God heard their complaint means that God responded to it. Likewise, the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">zakhar</font>, &#8220;to remember&#8221;) means to begin to act on the basis of what is remembered. A prayer to God that says, &#8220;Remember me,&#8221; is asking for more than mere recollection (see B. S. Childs, <i>Memory and Tradition in Israel</i> [SBT], 1-8). The structure of this section at the end of the chapter is powerful. There are four descriptions of the Israelites, with a fourfold reaction from God. On the Israelites&#8217; side, they groaned (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1504;&#1463;&#1495;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">anakh</font>], <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1511;&#1464;&#1492;</font> [<font face="Scholar">n&#255;</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aqah</font>]) and cried out (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1511;</font> [<font face="Scholar">za</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aq</font>], <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1492;</font> [<font face="Scholar">shav</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>]) to God. On the divine side God heard (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1506;</font>, <font face="Scholar">shama</font>&#8217;) their groaning, remembered (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">zakhar</font>) his covenant, looked (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ra</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>) at the Israelites, and took notice (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1506;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yada</font>&#8217;) of them. These verbs emphasize God&#8217;s sympathy and compassion for the people. God is near to those in need; in fact, the deliverer had already been chosen. It is important to note at this point the repetition of the word &#8220;God.&#8221; The text is waiting to introduce the name &#8220;Yahweh&#8221; in a special way. Meanwhile, the fourfold repetition of &#8220;God&#8221; in <ref id="1559-1580">vv. 24-25</ref> is unusual and draws attention to the statements about his attention to Israel&#8217;s plight.<br /></span></span>   his <span class="w H1285" data-lemma="H1285">covenant</span> <span class="w H854" data-lemma="H854">with</span> <span class="w H85" data-lemma="H85">Abraham</span>,  <span class="w H854" data-lemma="H854">with</span> <span class="w H3327" data-lemma="H3327">Isaac</span>,  and <span class="w H854" data-lemma="H854">with</span> <span class="w H3290" data-lemma="H3290">Jacob</span>,  </span>

The last clause contains a widely used verb for knowing, but it leaves the object unexpressed within the clause, so as to allow all that <ref id="1558-1579">vv. 23-24</ref> have described to serve as the compelling content of God&#8217;s knowing. (Many modern English versions supply an object for the verb following the LXX, which reads &#8220;knew <i>them</i>.&#8221;) The idea seems to be that God took personal knowledge of, noticed, or regarded them. In other passages the verb &#8220;know&#8221; is similar in meaning to &#8220;save&#8221; or &#8220;show pity.&#8221; See especially <ref id="446">Gen 18:21</ref>; <ref id="13946, 14339">Ps 1:6; 31:7</ref>, and <ref id="22398">Amos 3:2</ref>. Exodus has already provided an example of the results of not knowing in <ref id="1541">1:8</ref> (cf. <ref id="1635">5:2</ref>).<br /></span></span>    </span>

<h3>Jeremiah Confronted by a False Prophet</h3>
<p>
<span class="verse Jer_28_1" data-osis="Jer.28.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>The following events <span class="w H1961" data-lemma="H1961">occurred</span> in that <span class="w H1931" data-lemma="H1931">same</span> <span class="w H8141" data-lemma="H8141">year</span>,  <span class="w H7225" data-lemma="H7225">early</span> in the <span class="w H4467" data-lemma="H4467">reign</span> of <span class="w H4428" data-lemma="H4428">King</span> <span class="w H6667" data-lemma="H6667">Zedekiah</span> of <span class="w H3063" data-lemma="H3063">Judah</span>.  To be more precise, it was the <span class="w H2549" data-lemma="H2549">fifth</span> <span class="w H2320" data-lemma="H2320">month</span> of the <span class="w H7243" data-lemma="H7243">fourth</span> <span class="w H8141" data-lemma="H8141">year</span> of his reign.<span class="note"><span class="key">1</span><span class="text"><b>tc</b> The original text is unusually full here and deemed by many scholars to be corrupt: <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And it happened in that year in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, in the fifth month Hananiah&#8230;said to&#8230;&#8221; Many scholars see a contradiction between &#8220;in the fourth year&#8221; and &#8220;in the beginning of the reign.&#8221; These scholars point to the fact that the Greek version does not have &#8220;in that year&#8221; and &#8220;in the beginning of the reign of&#8221;; it merely reads &#8220;in the fourth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fifth month.&#8221; These scholars generally also regard the heading at <ref id="19598">27:1</ref> to be unoriginal and interpret the heading in the MT here as a faulty harmonization of the original (that in the Greek version) with the erroneous one in the Hebrew of <ref id="19598">27:1</ref>. However, it is just as possible that the Greek version in both places is an attempt to harmonize the data of <ref id="19598">27:1</ref> and <ref id="99999">28:1</ref>. I.e., it left out both the heading at <ref id="19598">27:1</ref>, and &#8220;in that year&#8221; and &#8220;at the beginning of the reign of&#8221; in the heading here because it thought the data was contradictory. However, it is just as likely that there is really no contradiction here. I.e., the term &#8220;beginning of the reign&#8221; can include the fourth year. E. H. Merrill has argued that the term here refers not to the accession year (see the translator&#8217;s note on <ref id="19574">26:1</ref>) but to the early years in general (&#8220;The &#8216;Accession Year&#8217; and Davidic Chronology,&#8221; JANESCU 19 [1989]: 105-6, and cf. note 18 for bibliography on Akkadian parallels). Hence the phrase has been translated both here and in <ref id="19598">27:1</ref> &#8220;early in the reign of&#8230;&#8221; For other attempts at harmonization see the discussion in G. L. Keown, P. J. Scalise, T. G. Smothers, <i>Jeremiah 26-52</i> (WBC), 41, n. 1a.<br /><br/></br><b>sn</b> The dating here is very full and precise. &#8220;In that same year&#8221; ties the events here in with the messages that Jeremiah delivered to the envoys, the king and his court, and the priests and people while wearing the yoke symbolizing servitude to Nebuchadnezzar. The text wants to show that the events here transpired shortly after those in Jer 27 and that Jeremiah is still wearing the yoke. The supplying of the precise month is important because the end of the chapter will show that Jeremiah&#8217;s prophecy regarding Hananiah was fulfilled two months later. Hence Jeremiah is the true prophet and Hananiah and the others (<ref id="19613">27:16</ref>) are false. The supplying of the year is perhaps significant because the author states in <ref id="20272">51:59</ref> that Zedekiah went to Babylon that same year, probably to pledge his loyalty. The suggestion lies ready to hand that the events of this chapter and the preceding one lead to his dismissal of the false prophet Hananiah&#8217;s advice and the acceptance of Jeremiah&#8217;s.<br /></span></span>  The <span class="w H5030" data-lemma="H5030">prophet</span> <span class="w H2608" data-lemma="H2608">Hananiah</span> <span class="w H1121" data-lemma="H1121">son</span> of <span class="w H5809" data-lemma="H5809">Azzur</span>,  <span class="w H834" data-lemma="H834">who</span> was from <span class="w H1391" data-lemma="H1391">Gibeon</span>,  <span class="w H559" data-lemma="H559">spoke</span> <span class="w H413" data-lemma="H413">to</span> Jeremiah<span class="note"><span class="key">2</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;to me.&#8221; The rest of the chapter is all in third person narrative (see <ref id="19624">vv. 5</ref>, 6, 10, 11, 12, 15). Hence, many explain the first person here as a misunderstanding of the abbreviation &#8220;to Jeremiah&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500; &#1497;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el yirmiyyah</font>] = <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1463;&#1497;</font>, [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elay</font>]). It is just as likely that there is a similar kind of disjunction here that was found in <ref id="19598-19599">27:1-2</ref> only in the opposite direction. There what started out as a third person report was really a first person report. Here what starts out as a first person report is really a third person report. The text betrays both the hands of the narrator, probably Baruch, and the reportee, Jeremiah, who dictated a synopsis of his messages and his stories to Baruch to write down (<ref id="19847, 19875">Jer 36:4, 32</ref>).<br /></span></span>  in the <span class="w H3068" data-lemma="H3068">Lord’s</span> <span class="w H1004" data-lemma="H1004">temple</span> in the <span class="w H5869" data-lemma="H5869">presence</span> of the <span class="w H3548" data-lemma="H3548">priests</span> and <span class="w H3605" data-lemma="H3605">all</span> the <span class="w H5971" data-lemma="H5971">people</span>.<span class="note"><span class="key">3</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And it happened in that year in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, in the fifth month, Hananiah son of Azzur the prophet who was from Gibeon said to me in&#8230;&#8221; The sentence has been broken up in conformity with contemporary English style and the flavor given in modern equivalent terms.<br /></span></span>    </span>

Hananiah is given the same title &#8220;the prophet&#8221; as Jeremiah throughout the chapter and claims to speak with the same authority (compare <ref id="19621">v. 2</ref>a with <ref id="19618">27:21</ref>a). He even speaks like the true prophet; the verb form &#8220;I will break&#8221; is in the &#8220;prophetic perfect&#8221; emphasizing certitude. His message here is a contradiction of Jeremiah&#8217;s message recorded in the preceding chapter (compare especially <ref id="19622">v. 3</ref> with <ref id="19613, 19616-19619">27:16, 19-22</ref> and <ref id="19623">v. 4</ref> with <ref id="19479-19483">22:24-28</ref>). The people and the priests are thus confronted with a choice of whom to believe. Who is the &#8220;true&#8221; prophet and who is the &#8220;false&#8221; one? Only fulfillment of their prophecies will prove which is which (see <ref id="5406-5407">Deut 18:21-22</ref>).<br /></span></span>  to the <span class="w H4428" data-lemma="H4428">king</span> of <span class="w H894" data-lemma="H894">Babylon</span>.  </span>

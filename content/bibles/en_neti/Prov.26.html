It was commonly believed in the ancient world that blessings and curses had power in themselves, that once spoken they were effectual. But scripture makes it clear that the power of a blessing or a curse depends on the power of the one behind it (e.g., <ref id="4414, 4425">Num 22:38; 23:8</ref>). A curse would only take effect if the one who declared it had the authority to do so, and he would only do that if the curse was deserved.<br /></span></span>   does <span class="w H3808" data-lemma="H3808">not</span> <span class="w H935" data-lemma="H935">come</span> to rest.<span class="note"><span class="key">4</span><span class="text"><b>tc</b> The MT has the negative with the verb &#8220;to enter; to come&#8221; to mean &#8220;will not come&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488; &#1514;&#1464;&#1489;&#1465;&#1488;</font>, <font face="Scholar">lo</font>&#8217; <font face="Scholar">tavo</font>&#8217;). This is interpreted to mean &#8220;will not come to rest&#8221; or &#8220;will not come home.&#8221; Some commentators have taken the <i>Qere</i> reading of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lo</font>) instead, and read it as &#8220;will come home to him.&#8221; This is also a little difficult; but it gives the idea that an undeserved curse will come [back] to him [who gave it]. Just as a bird will fly around and eventually come home, so will the undeserved curse return on the one who gave it. This is plausible; but there is no referent for the suffix, making it syntactically difficult.<br /></span></span> </span>

While this does not resolve the issue, it does give a sound application for the two verses together &#8211; in negligible issues one should just ignore the stupid person, but in issues that matter the fool must be dealt with, lest credence be given to what he says (W.

One should not lower himself to the level of the fool, but there are times when the lesser of two evils is to do so, other than let the fool gain confidence that he is a wise person or be considered wise by others. Paul, for example, talked like a &#8220;fool&#8221; to correct the foolish ideas of the Corinthians (<ref id="29006-29007, 29034">2 Cor 11:16-17; 12:11</ref>).<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H6435" data-lemma="H6435">lest</span> he <span class="w H1961" data-lemma="H1961">be</span> <span class="w H2450" data-lemma="H2450">wise</span> in his <span class="w H5869" data-lemma="H5869">own estimation</span>.<span class="note"><span class="key">9</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in his own eyes&#8221; (so NAB, NASB, NIV).<br /></span></span>   </span>

The other simile uses &#8220;violence,&#8221; a term for violent social wrongs and injustice.

That is not to say it is the correct rendering, only that it makes sense as a required negative statement in a proverb.

The &#8220;tongue of deception&#8221; (using a metonymy of cause with an attributive genitive) means that what is said is false.

The statement that the lying tongue &#8220;hates those crushed by it&#8221; suggests that the sentiments of hatred help the deceiver justify what he says about people. The ruin that he brings is probably on other people, but it could also be taken to include his own ruin.<br /></span></span>   </span>

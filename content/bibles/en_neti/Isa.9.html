Here it probably refers to the king&#8217;s ability to devise military strategy, as suggested by the context (cf. <ref id="17833-17834">vv. 3-4</ref> and the following title <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500; &#1490;&#1468;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">el gibor</font>). In <ref id="17887">Isa 11:2</ref> (also a description of this king) <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1461;&#1510;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">etsah</font>) is linked with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">g&#255;vurah</font>, the latter being typically used of military might, cf. BDB 150 s.v.). Note also <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1461;&#1510;&#1464;&#1492; &#1493;&#1468;&#1490;&#1456;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492; &#1500;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1500;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font> in <ref id="18336">Isa 36:5</ref>. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1462;&#1500;&#1462;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">pele</font>&#8217;) is typically used of God (cf. however <ref id="20320">Lam 1:9</ref>). Does this suggest the deity of the messianic ruler? The NT certainly teaches he is God, but did Isaiah necessarily have this in mind over 700 years before his birth? Since <ref id="17887">Isa 11:2</ref> points out that this king will receive the spirit of the Lord, which will enable him to counsel, it is possible to argue that the king&#8217;s counsel is &#8220;extraordinary&#8221; because it finds its source in the divine spirit. Thus this title does not necessarily suggest that the ruler is deity.<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H1368" data-lemma="H1368">Mighty</span> <span class="w H410" data-lemma="H410">God</span>,<span class="note"><span class="key">18</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gibbor</font>) is probably an attributive adjective (&#8220;mighty God&#8221;), though one might translate &#8220;God is a warrior&#8221; or &#8220;God is mighty.&#8221; Scholars have interpreted this title is two ways. A number of them have argued that the title portrays the king as God&#8217;s representative on the battlefield, whom God empowers in a supernatural way (see J. H. Hayes and S. A. Irvine, <i>Isaiah</i>, 181-82). They contend that this sense seems more likely in the original context of the prophecy. They would suggest that having read the NT, we might in retrospect interpret this title as indicating the coming king&#8217;s deity, but it is unlikely that Isaiah or his audience would have understood the title in such a bold way. <ref id="14604">Ps 45:6</ref> addresses the Davidic king as &#8220;God&#8221; because he ruled and fought as God&#8217;s representative on earth. Ancient Near Eastern art and literature picture gods training kings for battle, bestowing special weapons, and intervening in battle. According to Egyptian propaganda, the Hittites described Rameses II as follows: &#8220;No man is he who is among us, It is Seth great-of-strength, Baal in person; Not deeds of man are these his doings, They are of one who is unique&#8221; (See Miriam Lichtheim, <i>Ancient Egyptian Literature</i>, <ref id="99999">2:67</ref>). According to proponents of this view, <ref id="17836">Isa 9:6</ref> probably envisions a similar kind of response when friends and foes alike look at the Davidic king in full battle regalia. When the king&#8217;s enemies oppose him on the battlefield, they are, as it were, fighting against God himself. The other option is to regard this title as a reference to God, confronting Isaiah&#8217;s readers with the divinity of this promised &#8220;child.&#8221; The use of this same title that clearly refers to God in a later passage (<ref id="17872">Isa 10:21</ref>) supports this interpretation. Other passages depict Yahweh as the great God and great warrior (<ref id="5204">Deut 10:17</ref>; <ref id="19750">Jer. 32:18</ref>). Although this connection of a child who is born with deity is unparalleled in any earlier biblical texts, Isaiah&#8217;s use of this title to make this connection represents Isaiah&#8217;s attempt (at God&#8217;s behest) to advance Israel in their understanding of the ideal Davidic king for whom they long.<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H5703" data-lemma="H5703">Everlasting</span> Father,<span class="note"><span class="key">19</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> This title must not be taken in an anachronistic Trinitarian sense. (To do so would be theologically problematic, for the &#8220;Son&#8221; is the messianic king and is distinct in his person from God the &#8220;Father.&#8221;) Rather, in its original context the title pictures the king as the protector of his people. For a similar use of &#8220;father&#8221; see <ref id="18074">Isa 22:21</ref> and <ref id="13549">Job 29:16</ref>. This figurative, idiomatic use of &#8220;father&#8221; is not limited to the Bible. In a Phoenician inscription (ca. 850-800 <sc>b.c.</sc>) the ruler Kilamuwa declares: &#8220;To some I was a father, to others I was a mother.&#8221; In another inscription (ca. 800 <sc>b.c.</sc>) the ruler Azitawadda boasts that the god Baal made him &#8220;a father and a mother&#8221; to his people. (See <i>ANET</i> 499-500.) The use of &#8220;everlasting&#8221; might suggest the deity of the king (as the one who has total control over eternity), but Isaiah and his audience may have understood the term as royal hyperbole emphasizing the king&#8217;s long reign or enduring dynasty (for examples of such hyperbolic language used of the Davidic king, see <ref id="8749">1 Kgs 1:31</ref>; <ref id="14196-14198, 14826-14827, 15006, 15018">Pss 21:4-6; 61:6-7; 72:5, 17</ref>). The New Testament indicates that the hyperbolic language (as in the case of the title &#8220;Mighty God&#8221;) is literally realized in the ultimate fulfillment of the prophecy, for Jesus will rule eternally.<br /></span></span> <span class="w H8269" data-lemma="H8269">Prince</span> of <span class="w H7965" data-lemma="H7965">Peace</span>.<span class="note"><span class="key">20</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> This title pictures the king as one who establishes a safe socio-economic environment for his people. It hardly depicts him as a meek individual, for he establishes peace through military strength (as the preceding context and the first two royal titles indicate). His people experience safety and prosperity because their invincible king destroys their enemies. See Pss 72 and 144 for parallels to these themes.<br /></span></span>   </span>

The speech seems to describe a series of past judgments on the northern kingdom which is ready to intensify further in the devastation announced in 10:1-4.

In either case, the metaphor is that of a desperately hungry man who resorts to an almost unthinkable act to satisfy his appetite. He eats everything he can find to his right, but still being unsatisfied, then turns to his left and eats everything he can find there. Still being desperate for food, he then resorts to eating his own flesh (or offspring, as this phrase is metaphorically understood by some English versions, e.g., NIV, NCV, TEV, NLT). The reality behind the metaphor is the political turmoil of the period, as the next verse explains. There was civil strife within the northern kingdom; even the descendants of Joseph were at each other&#8217;s throats. Then the northern kingdom turned on their southern brother, Judah.<br /></span></span>   </span>

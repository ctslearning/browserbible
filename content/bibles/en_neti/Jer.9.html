Jeremiah, you live in the midst of deceitful people. They deceitfully refuse to take any thought of/acknowledge me.&#8221; The translation which has been adopted is based on a redivision of the lines, a redivision of some of the words, and a revocalization of some of the consonants. The MT reads literally &#8220;doing wrong they weary themselves. Your sitting in the midst of deceit; in deceit they refuse to know me&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1493;&#1461;&#1492; &#1504;&#1460;&#1500;&#1456;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1475; &#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464; &#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1514;&#1493;&#1465;&#1498;&#1456; &#1502;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1502;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492; &#1502;&#1461;&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; &#1491;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;&#1470;&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</font>). The Greek version reads literally &#8220;they do wrong and they do not cease to turn themselves around. Usury upon usury and deceit upon deceit. They do not want to know me.&#8221; This suggests that one should read the Hebrew text as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1467;&#1489;&#1475; &#1514;&#1468;&#1465;&#1498;&#1456; &#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1514;&#1493;&#1465;&#1498;&#1456; &#1502;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1470;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1502;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1470;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492; &#1502;&#1461;&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; &#1491;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1514; &#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497; &#1492;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1493;&#1461;&#1492; &#1504;&#1460;&#1500;&#1456;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;</font>, which translated literally yields &#8220;doing evil [= &#8220;they do evil&#8221; using the Hiphil infinitive absolute as a finite verb (cf. GKC 346 &#167;113.<i>ff</i>)] they are not able [cf. KBL 468 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1492;</font> Niph.3 and see <ref id="1704">Exod 7:18</ref> for parallel use] to repent. Oppression on oppression [cf.

They refuse to know me.&#8221; This reading has ancient support and avoids the introduction of an unexpected second masculine suffix into the context. It has been adopted here along with a number of modern commentaries (cf., e.g., W.

The words are supplied in the translation for clarity and to help resolve a rather confusing issue of who is speaking throughout <ref id="19182-19197">vv. 16-21</ref>. As has been evident throughout the translation, the speaker is not always indicated. Sometimes it is not even clear who the speaker is. In general the translation and the notes have reflected the general consensus in identifying who it is. Here, however, there is a good deal of confusion about who is speaking in <ref id="19194">v<ref id="19194">v. 18</ref></ref>, 20-21. The Greek translation has the <sc>Lord</sc> speaking throughout with second plural pronouns in <ref id="19194">vv. 18</ref>, 21 and the absence of the first line in <ref id="19198">v. 22</ref>. It would be hard to explain how the MT arose if it were the original text. Critical commentators such as J. Bright, W. Holladay, and W. McKane resolve the issue by dropping out the introductory formula in <ref id="19193">v. 17</ref> and the first line of <ref id="19198">v. 22</ref> and assigning the whole lament to Jeremiah. It seems obvious from the first plural pronouns and the content of v. 18 (and probably <ref id="19197">v. 21</ref> as well) and the fact that the <sc>Lord</sc> is referred to in other than the first person in <ref id="19196">v. 20</ref> that he is not the speaker of those verses. I have attempted to resolve the issue by having Jeremiah report the <sc>Lord</sc>&#8217;s command in <ref id="19193">v. 17</ref> and have the rest of the speech be essentially that of Jeremiah. It should be admitted, however, that the issue is far from resolved. Most English versions simply ignore the problem. The GNB (= TEV) is a rare exception.<br /></span></span> <span class="w H995" data-lemma="H995">“Take note</span> of what I say.<span class="note"><span class="key">46</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Consider!&#8221;<br /></span></span> <span class="w H7121" data-lemma="H7121">Call</span> for the <span class="w H6969" data-lemma="H6969">women who mourn</span> for the dead!

The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1512;</font> may be interpreted as a Piel masculine singular imperative addressed to Jeremiah (as in the first alternate translation where it is placed at the end for the sake of clarity) or as a Piel infinitive absolute either explaining what the woman are to teach their daughters and neighbors (as in the second alternate translation; cf. GKC 341 &#167;113.<i>h</i>, <i>i</i> for this use of the infinitive absolute) or as equivalent to an imperative addressed to the women telling them to tell their daughters and neighbors the reason for the lament, i.e., the <sc>Lord</sc>&#8217;s promise of widespread death (cf. GKC 346 &#167;113.<i>bb</i> for this use of the infinitive absolute). The translation chosen has opted for <ref id="19197">v. 21</ref> as the content of the lament and <ref id="19198">v. 22</ref> as the further explanation that Jeremiah has the women pass on to their neighbors and daughters. This appears to this interpreter to create the least confusion and dislocation in the flow of the passage.<br /></span></span>    </span>

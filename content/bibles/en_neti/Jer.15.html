The text answers the question &#8220;Where should we go?&#8221; with four brief staccato-like expressions with a play on the preposition &#8220;to&#8221;: <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Who to the death, to the death and who to the sword, to the sword and who to the starvation, to the starvation and who to the captivity, to the captivity.&#8221; The word &#8220;death&#8221; here is commonly understood to be a poetic substitute for &#8220;plague&#8221; because of the standard trio of sword, famine, and plague (see, e.g., <ref id="19306">14:12</ref> and the notes there). This is likely here and in <ref id="19406">18:21</ref>. For further support see W. L. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah</i> (Hermeneia), <ref id="99999">1:440</ref>. The nuance &#8220;starvation&#8221; rather than &#8220;famine&#8221; has been chosen in the translation because the referents here are all things that accompany war.<br /></span></span>   </span>

The verb translated &#8220;punish&#8221; is often used that way (cf. BDB 823 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1491;</font> Qal.A.3 and compare usage in <ref id="19249, 19288">Jer 11:22; 13:21</ref>). However, here it is accompanied by a direct object and a preposition meaning &#8220;over&#8221; which is usually used in the sense of appointing someone over someone (cf. BDB 823 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1491;</font> Qal.B.1 and compare usage in <ref id="20240">Jer 51:27</ref>). Moreover the word translated &#8220;different ways&#8221; normally refers to &#8220;families,&#8221; &#8220;clans,&#8221; or &#8220;guilds&#8221; (cf. BDB 1046-47 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1495;&#1464;&#1492;</font> for usage). Hence the four things mentioned are referred to figuratively as officers or agents into whose power the <sc>Lord</sc> consigns them. The Hebrew text reads: &#8220;I will appoint over them four guilds, the sword to kill, the dogs to drag away, the birds of the skies and the beasts of the earth to devour and to destroy.&#8221;<br /></span></span> </span> </span>

For examples see <ref id="19918, 20051">Jer 38:22; 46:5</ref>. The only other occurrence in Jeremiah has been in the unusual idiom in <ref id="19144">7:24</ref> where it was translated &#8220;they got worse and worse instead of better.&#8221; That is how J. Bright (<i>Jeremiah</i> [AB], 109) translates it here.

KJV, NASB, NIV for example render them as future. ASV, RSV, TEV render them as past. NJPS has past here and future in <ref id="19323-19325">vv. 7-9</ref>. This is perhaps the best solution. The imperfect + <i>vav</i> consecutive here responds to the perfect in the first line. The imperfects + <i>vav</i> consecutives followed by perfects in <ref id="19323-19325">vv. 7-9</ref> and concluded by an imperfect in <ref id="19325">v. 9</ref> pick up the perfects + <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutives in <ref id="19319-19320">vv. 3-4</ref>. Verses 7-9 are further development of the theme in <ref id="19317-19320">vv. 1-4</ref>. Verses 5-6 have been an apostrophe or a turning aside to address Jerusalem directly. For a somewhat similar alternation of the tenses see <ref id="17754-17757">Isa 5:14-17</ref> and consult GKC 329-30 &#167;111.<i>w</i>. One could of course argue that the imperfects + <i>vav</i> consecutive in <ref id="19323-19325">vv. 7-9</ref> continue the imperfect + <i>vav</i> consecutive here. In this case, <ref id="19323-19325">vv. 7-9</ref> are not a continuation of the oracle of doom but another lament by God (cf. <ref id="19295-19300, 19311-19312">14:1-6, 17-18</ref>).<br /></span></span>  I have <span class="w H3811" data-lemma="H3811">grown tired</span> of <span class="w H5162" data-lemma="H5162">feeling sorry</span> for you!”<span class="note"><span class="key">15</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> It is difficult to be sure what intertextual connections are intended by the author in his use of vocabulary. The Hebrew word translated &#8220;grown tired&#8221; is not very common. It has been used twice before. In <ref id="19181-19182">9:5-6</ref>b where it refers to the people being unable to repent and in <ref id="19101">6:11</ref> where it refers to Jeremiah being tired or unable to hold back his anger because of that inability. Now God too has worn out his patience with them (cf. <ref id="17796">Isa 7:13</ref>).<br /></span></span> </span>

Winnowing was the process whereby a mixture of grain and straw was thrown up into the wind to separate the grain from the straw and the husks.

The Hebrew text reads: &#8220;I will bring in to them, against mother of young men, a destroyer at noon time.&#8221; Many commentaries delete the phrase with the Greek text. If the preposition read &#8220;against&#8221; like the following one this would be a case of apposition of nearer definition. There is some evidence of that in the Targum and the Syriac according to <i>BHS</i>. Both nouns &#8220;mothers&#8221; and &#8220;young men&#8221; are translated as plural here though they are singular; they are treated by most as collectives.

It is supplied in the translation for clarity to identify the referent of &#8220;you.&#8221; A comparison of three or four English versions will show how difficult this verse is to interpret. The primary difficulty is with the meaning of the verb rendered here as &#8220;I will surely send you out [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1512;&#1460;&#1493;&#1514;&#1460;&#1498;&#1464;</font>, <font face="Scholar">sherivtikha</font>].&#8221; The text and the meaning of the word are debated (for a rather full discussion see W. L. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah</i> [Hermeneia], <ref id="1-1">1:446-47</ref>, n. b-b). Tied up with that is the meaning of the verb in the second line and the identification of who the speaker and addressee are. One of two approaches are usually followed. Some follow the Greek version which has Jeremiah speaking and supporting his complaint that he has been faithful. In this case the word &#8220;said&#8221; is left out, the difficult verb is taken to mean &#8220;I have served you&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1512;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1498;&#1464;</font> [<font face="Scholar">sheratikha</font>] from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1514;</font> [<font face="Scholar">sharat</font>; BDB 1058 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1514;</font>]) and the parallel verb means &#8220;I have made intercession for my enemies.&#8221; The second tack is to suppose that God is speaking and is promising Jeremiah deliverance from his detractors. In this case the troublesome word is taken to mean &#8220;deliver&#8221; (cf. BDB 1056 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font>), &#8220;strengthen&#8221; (see BDB&#8217;s discussion) or read as a noun &#8220;remnant&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;</font> = <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;</font> [<font face="Scholar">sheritekha</font> = <font face="Scholar">sh&#255;</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">eritekha</font>]; again see BDB&#8217;s discussion). In this case the parallel verb is taken to mean &#8220;I will cause your enemies to entreat you,&#8221; a meaning it has nowhere else. Both of these approaches are probably wrong. The Greek text is the only evidence for leaving out &#8220;said.&#8221; The problem with making Jeremiah the addressee is twofold. First, the word &#8220;enemy&#8221; is never used in the book of Jeremiah&#8217;s foes, always of political enemies. Second, and more troublesome, one must assume a shift in the addressee between <ref id="19327">v. 11</ref> and vv.13-14 or assume that the whole is addressed. The latter would be odd if he is promised deliverance from his detractors only to be delivered to captivity. If, however, one assumes that the whole is addressed to Jerusalem, there is no such problem. A check of earlier chapters will show that the second masculine pronoun is used for Judah/Jerusalem in <ref id="18994-18995, 19029-19030, 19076-19077, 19240">2:28-29; 4:1-2; 5:17-18; 11:13</ref>. In <ref id="18994-18994">2:28-28</ref> and <ref id="1-1">4:1-2</ref> the same shift from second singular to second plural takes place as does here in <ref id="19319-19330">vv. 13-14</ref>. Moreover, <ref id="19319-19330">vv. 13-14</ref> continue much of the same vocabulary and is addressed to Jerusalem. The approach followed here is similar to that taken in REB except &#8220;for good&#8221; is taken in the way it is always used rather to mean &#8220;utterly.&#8221; The nuance suggested by BDB 1056 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> is assumed and the meaning of the parallel verb is assumed to be similar to that in <ref id="18718">Isa 53:6</ref> (see BDB 803 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1490;&#1463;&#1506;</font> Hiph.1). The MT is retained with demonstrable meanings. For the concept of &#8220;for good&#8221; see <ref id="19530-19531">Jer 24:5-6</ref>.

The translation and meaning of this verse are debated. See note for further details. The two main difficulties here involve the relation of words to one another and the obscure allusion to iron from the north. To translate &#8220;literally&#8221; is difficult since one does not know whether &#8220;iron&#8221; is subject of &#8220;break&#8221; or object of an impersonal verb. Likewise, the dangling &#8220;and bronze&#8221; fits poorly with either understanding. Options: &#8220;Can iron break iron from the north and bronze?&#8221; Or &#8220;Can one break iron, even iron from the north and bronze.&#8221; This last is commonly opted for by translators and interpreters, but why add &#8220;and bronze&#8221; at the end? And what does &#8220;iron from the north&#8221; refer to? A long history of interpretation relates it to the foe from the north (see already <ref id="18961, 19034, 19091, 19287">1:14; 4:6; 6:1; 13:20</ref>). The translation follows the lead of NRSV and takes &#8220;and bronze&#8221; as a compound subject. I have no ready parallels for this syntax but the reference to &#8220;from the north&#8221; and the comparison to the stubbornness of the unrepentant people to bronze and iron in <ref id="19118">6:28</ref> suggests a possible figurative allusion. There is no evidence in the Bible that Israel knew about a special kind of steel like iron from the Black Sea mentioned in later Greek sources. The word &#8220;fist&#8221; is supplied in the translation to try to give some hint that it refers to a hostile force.<br /><br/></br><b>sn</b> Compare <ref id="17856-17857">Isa 10:5-6</ref> for the idea here.<br /></span></span>   </span>

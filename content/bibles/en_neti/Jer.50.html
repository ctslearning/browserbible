In <ref id="22189">Hos 7:10</ref> it is in parallel with returning to the <sc>Lord</sc>. In <ref id="14942">Ps 69:6</ref> it is in parallel with hoping in or trusting in the <sc>Lord</sc>. Perhaps the most helpful parallels here, however, are <ref id="22134">Hos 3:5</ref> (in comparison with <ref id="19677">Jer 30:9</ref>) and <ref id="11506">2 Chr 15:15</ref> where it is in the context of a covenant commitment to be loyal to the <sc>Lord</sc> which is similar to the context here (see the next verse). The translation is admittedly paraphrastic but &#8220;seeking the <sc>Lord</sc>&#8221; does not mean here looking for God as though he were merely a person to be found.<br /></span></span>   </span>

In Hebrew the word would mean &#8220;double rebellion&#8221; and would stand as an epithet for the land of Babylon as a whole.

According to <i>BHS</i> this reading is supported by the Lucianic and Hexaplaric recensions of the LXX (the Greek version) and the Syriac version. In this case the drying up of the waters (of the canals) is attributed to neglect brought about by war conditions. However, it is just as likely that these versions are influenced by the repetition of the word &#8220;sword&#8221; as the Hebrew and the other versions are influenced by the concept of &#8220;drying up&#8221; of the waters to read &#8220;drought.&#8221; Hence the present translation, along with the majority of modern English versions, retains the Hebrew &#8220;drought.&#8221;<br /></span></span>  All of this will happen <span class="w H3588" data-lemma="H3588">because</span> her <span class="w H776" data-lemma="H776">land</span> is filled with <span class="w H6456" data-lemma="H6456">idols</span>.<span class="note"><span class="key">99</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for it is a land of idols.&#8221; The &#8220;for,&#8221; however, goes back to the whole context not just to the preceding prediction (cf.

The translation of this line follows the interpretation of the majority of modern English versions and all the commentaries consulted. NIV, NCV, and God&#8217;s Word reflect a different syntax, understanding the subject to be the idols just mentioned rather than &#8220;her people&#8221; which is supplied here for the sake of clarity (the Hebrew text merely says &#8220;they.&#8221;) Following that lead, one could render &#8220;but those idols will go mad with terror.&#8221; This makes excellent sense in the context which often refers to effects (<ref id="20203">vv. 36</ref>b, d, 37c, 38b) of the war that is coming. However, that interpretation does not fit as well with the following &#8220;therefore/so,&#8221; which basically introduces a judgment or consequence after an accusation of sin.<br /></span></span>    </span>

What is described, then, is someone too timid, too afraid, or not trusting enough to admit that reproof is a genuine part of love (W. McKane, <i>Proverbs</i> [OTL], 610).

W. Thomas suggests, &#8220;counsels of a friend make sweet the soul&#8221; (&#8220;Notes on Some Passages in the Book of Proverbs,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 15 [1965]: 275). G. R. Driver suggests, &#8220;the counsel of a friend is sweeter than one&#8217;s own advice&#8221; (literally, &#8220;more than the counsel of the soul&#8221;). He also suggests &#8220;more than of fragrant wood.&#8221; See G. R. Driver, &#8220;Hebrew Notes,&#8221; <i>ZAW</i> 52 (1934): 54; <i>idem</i>, &#8220;Suggestions and Objections,&#8221; <i>ZAW</i> 55 (1937): 69-70. The LXX reads &#8220;and the soul is rent by misfortunes.&#8221; The MT, for want of better or more convincing readings, may be interpreted to mean something like &#8220;[Just as] ointment and incense brings joy to the heart, [so] the sweetness of one&#8217;s friend [comes] from his sincere counsel.&#8221;<br /></span></span>   </span>

It may simply be saying that people should retain family relationships but will discover that a friend who is available is better than a relative who is not. But C. H. Toy thinks that the verse is made up of three lines that have no connection: 10a instructs people to maintain relationships, 10b says not to go to a brother&#8217;s house [only?] when disaster strikes, and 10c observes that a nearby friend is better than a far-away relative. C. H. Toy suggests a connection may have been there, but has been lost (<i>Proverbs</i> [ICC], 485-86). The conflict between <ref id="16891">17:17</ref> and 10b may be another example of presenting two sides of the issue, a fairly frequent occurrence in the book of Proverbs.<br /></span></span>   </span>

It is the only Aramaic sentence in Jeremiah. Scholars debate the appropriateness of this verse to this context. Many see it as a gloss added by a postexilic scribe which was later incorporated into the text. Both R. E. Clendenen (&#8220;Discourse Strategies in Jeremiah 10,&#8221; JBL 106 [1987]: 401-8) and W. L. Holladay (<i>Jeremiah</i> [Hermeneia], <ref id="1-1, 1-1">1:324-25, 334-35</ref>) have given detailed arguments that the passage is not only original but the climax and center of the contrast between the <sc>Lord</sc> and idols in <ref id="19204-19218">vv. 2-16</ref>. Holladay shows that the passage is a very carefully constructed chiasm (see accompanying study note) which argues that &#8220;these&#8221; at the end is the subject of the verb &#8220;will disappear&#8221; not the attributive adjective modifying heaven. He also makes a very good case that the verse is poetry and not prose as it is rendered in the majority of modern English versions.<br /><br/></br><b>sn</b> This passage is carefully structured and placed to contrast the <sc>Lord</sc> who is living and eternal (<ref id="19212">v. 10</ref>) and made the heavens and earth (<ref id="19214">v. 12</ref>) with the idols who did not and will disappear. It also has a very careful concentric structure in the original text where &#8220;the gods&#8221; is balanced by &#8220;these,&#8221; &#8220;heavens&#8221; is balance by &#8220;from under the heavens,&#8221; &#8220;the earth&#8221; is balanced by &#8220;from the earth,&#8221; and &#8220;did not make&#8221; is balanced and contrasted in the very center by &#8220;will disappear.&#8221; The structure is further reinforced by the sound play/wordplay between &#8220;did not make&#8221; (<i>Aram</i> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1488; &#1506;&#1458;&#1489;&#1463;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;</font> [<font face="Scholar">la</font>&#8217; &#8217;<font face="Scholar">avadu</font>]) and &#8220;will disappear&#8221; (<i>Aram</i> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1461;&#1488;&#1489;&#1463;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;</font> [<font face="Scholar">ye</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">vadu</font>]).

Some commentators follow the lead of the Greek and Latin versions which read the verb as a passive: &#8220;they will be found,&#8221; i.e., be caught and captured. Others follow a suggestion by G. R. Driver (&#8220;Linguistic and Textual Problems: Jeremiah,&#8221; <i>JQR</i> 28 [1937-38]: 107) that the verb be read not as &#8220;they will find&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1510;&#1464;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;</font> [<font face="Scholar">yimtsa</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">u</font>] from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1488;</font> [<font face="Scholar">matsa</font>&#8217;]) but &#8220;they will be squeezed/ drained&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;</font> [<font face="Scholar">yimtsu</font>] from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1492;</font> [<font face="Scholar">matsah</font>]). The translation adopted assumes that this is an example of the ellipsis of the object supplied from the context (cf. E. W. Bullinger, <i>Figures of Speech</i>, 8-12). For a similar nuance for the verb &#8220;find&#8221; = &#8220;feel/experience&#8221; see BDB 592 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1488;</font> Qal.1.f and compare the usage in <ref id="15852">Ps 116:3</ref>.<br /></span></span> </span>

It is not altogether clear who the speaker is in <ref id="19211-19227">vv. 19-25</ref>. The words of <ref id="19211-19222">vv. 19-20</ref> would best be assigned to a personified Jerusalem who laments the destruction of her city (under the figure of a tent) and the exile of her children (under the figure of children). However, the words of <ref id="19223">v. 21</ref> which assign responsibility to the rulers do not fit well in the mouth of the people but do fit Jeremiah. The words of <ref id="19224">v. 22</ref> are very appropriate to Jeremiah being similar to the report in <ref id="19047-19048">4:19-20</ref>. Likewise the words of <ref id="19225">v. 23</ref> which appear to express man&#8217;s incapacity to control his own destiny and his resignation to the fate which awaits him in the light of <ref id="19226">v. 24</ref> seem more appropriate to Jeremiah than to the people. There has been no indication elsewhere that the people have shown any indication of being resigned to their fate or willing to accept their punishment. Though the issue is far from resolved a majority of commentators see Jeremiah as the speaker so identifying himself with their fate that he speaks as though he were this personified figure. It is not altogether out of the question, however, that the speaker throughout is personified Jerusalem though I know of no commentator who takes that view. For those who are interested, the most thorough discussion of the issue is probably to be found in W. McKane, <i>Jeremiah</i> (ICC), <ref id="1-1">1:230-35</ref>, especially 233-35. Rendering the pronouns throughout as &#8220;we&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; alleviates some of the difficulty but some speaker needs to be identified in the introduction to allay any possible confusion.

Here &#8220;calling on your name&#8221; is parallel to &#8220;acknowledging you.&#8221; In many locations in the OT &#8220;name&#8221; is equivalent to the person. In the OT, the &#8220;name&#8221; reflected the person&#8217;s character (cf. <ref id="764">Gen 27:36</ref>; <ref id="7887">1 Sam 25:25</ref>) or his reputation (<ref id="271">Gen 11:4</ref>; <ref id="8223">2 Sam 8:13</ref>). To speak in a person&#8217;s name was to act as his representative or carry his authority (<ref id="7871">1 Sam 25:9</ref>; <ref id="9460">1 Kgs 21:8</ref>). To call someone&#8217;s name over something was to claim it for one&#8217;s own (<ref id="8315">2 Sam 12:28</ref>).<br /></span></span> <span class="w H3588" data-lemma="H3588">For</span> they have <span class="w H398" data-lemma="H398">destroyed</span> the people of <span class="w H3290" data-lemma="H3290">Jacob</span>.<span class="note"><span class="key">57</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;have devoured Jacob.&#8221;<br /></span></span>   They have completely <span class="w H398" data-lemma="H398">destroyed</span> them<span class="note"><span class="key">58</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;have almost completely destroyed them&#8221;; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;they have devoured them and consumed them.&#8221; The figure of hyperbole is used here; elsewhere Jeremiah and God refer to the fact that they will not be completely consumed.

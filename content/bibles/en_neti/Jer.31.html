There is debate whether the reference here is to God&#8217;s preservation of Israel during their wandering in the Sinai desert or his promise to protect and preserve them on their return through the Arabian desert on the way back from Assyria and Babylon (see e.g., <ref id="18495-18497, 18522-18527">Isa 42:14-16; 43:16-21</ref>; <ref id="19351-19352, 19492-19493">Jer 16:14-15; 23:7-8</ref>). The only finite verbs in <ref id="19694-19695">vv. 2-3</ref>a before the introduction of the quote are perfects which can denote either a past act or a future act viewed as certain of fulfillment (the prophetic perfect; see GKC 312-13 &#167;106.<i>n</i> and see examples in <ref id="19243, 19284, 19549, 19623">Jer 11:16; 13:17; 25:14; 28:4</ref>). The phrase at the beginning of <ref id="19695">v. 3</ref> can either refer to temporal (cf. BDB 935 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;&#1511;</font> 2.b and <ref id="18064">Isa 22:11</ref>) or spatial distance (cf.

The verb in the final clause in <ref id="19695">v. 3</ref> can refer to either the continuance of God&#8217;s love as in <ref id="14449">Ps 36:10</ref> (cf. BDB 604 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> Qal.5) or drawing someone to him in electing, caring love as in <ref id="22245">Hos 11:4</ref> (cf. BDB 604 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> Qal.1). The translation has opted for the prophetic reference to future deliverance because of the preceding context, the use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1461;&#1512;&#1464;&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">merakhoq</font>) to refer to the far off land of exile in <ref id="19678, 20073, 20263">Jer 30:10; 46:27; <ref id="20263">51:50</ref></ref>, and the reference to survivors from the sword being called on to remember the <sc>Lord</sc> in that far off land in 51:50.<br /></span></span> </span>

He will deliver those of Israel who remain alive.&#8221; The translation used in the text follows the Hebrew: &#8220;Rescue your people, O <sc>Lord</sc>, the remnant of Israel.&#8221; The alternate translation which is preferred by several modern English versions (e.g., REB, TEV) and a majority of modern commentaries (see, e.g., J. A. Thompson, <i>Jeremiah</i> [NICOT], 569; J. Bright, <i>Jeremiah</i> [AB], 273, n. s-s) follows the reading of the Greek version and the Aramaic Targum and appears more appropriate to the context of praise presupposed by the preceding imperatives. The difference in the two readings are the omission of one vowel letter and the confusion of a final <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kaf</font>) and a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">holem-vav</font>) which are very similar in form. (The Greek presupposes <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1506;&#1463; &#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492; &#1488;&#1462;&#1514;&#1470;&#1506;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;</font> [<font face="Scholar">hoshi</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">a y&#255;hvah</font> &#8217;<font face="Scholar">et-</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ammo</font>] for the Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1506; &#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492; &#1488;&#1462;&#1514;&#1470;&#1506;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1456;&#1498;&#1456;</font> [<font face="Scholar">hosha</font>&#8217; <font face="Scholar">y&#255;hvah</font> &#8217;<font face="Scholar">et-</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">amm&#255;kh</font>].) The key to a decision here is the shift from the verbs of praise to the imperative &#8220;say&#8221; which introduces the quotation; there is a shift from praise to petition. The shift in mood is not uncommon, occurring, for example, in <ref id="15895">Ps 118:25</ref> and <ref id="16120">126:4</ref>; it is the shift in mood between praise for what has begun to petition for what is further hoped for. It is easier to explain the origin contextually of the Greek and Targum than it is the Hebrew text, thus the Greek and Targum are probably a secondary smoothing of the text (this is the decision of the D. Barth&#233;lemy, ed., <i>Preliminary and Interim Report on the Hebrew Old Testament Text Project</i>, <ref id="99999">4:263</ref>). The mood of prayer also shows up in <ref id="19701">v. 9</ref> and again in <ref id="19699-19710">vv. 17-18</ref>.<br /></span></span>   </span>

The poetry is not speaking of two separate entities here; it is a way of repeating an idea for emphasis. Moreover, there is no intent to show special preference for northern Israel over Judah. All Israel is metaphorically God&#8217;s son and the object of his special care and concern (<ref id="1624">Exod 4:22</ref>; <ref id="5765">Deut 32:6</ref>).<br /></span></span>   is my <span class="w H1060" data-lemma="H1060">firstborn son</span>.’”   </span>

The Hebrew word translated &#8220;will set&#8230;free&#8221; is a word used in the legal sphere for paying a redemption price to secure the freedom of a person or thing (see, e.g., <ref id="1881, 1883">Exod 13:13, 15</ref>). It is used metaphorically and theologically to refer to Israel&#8217;s deliverance from Egyptian bondage (<ref id="5335">Deut 15:15</ref>; <ref id="22653">Mic 6:4</ref>) and its deliverance from Babylonian exile (<ref id="18331">Isa 35:10</ref>). The word translated &#8220;secure their release&#8221; is a word used in the sphere of family responsibility where a person paid the price to free an indentured relative (<ref id="3518, 3519">Lev 25:48, 49</ref>) or paid the price to restore a relative&#8217;s property seized to pay a debt (<ref id="3495, 3503">Lev 25:25, 33</ref>).

However, there is no other indication that this is a vision or a vision report. G. L. Keown, P. J. Scalise, and T. G. Smothers (<i>Jeremiah 26-52</i> [WBC], 124, 128-29) suggest that this is a speech of the restored (and refreshed) exiles like that which is formally introduced in <ref id="19715">v. 23</ref>. This speech, however, is not formally introduced. This interpretation is also reflected in TEV, CEV and is accepted here as fitting the context better and demanding less presuppositions. The Hebrew text reads literally, &#8220;Upon this I awoke and looked and my sleep was sweet to me.&#8221; Keown, Scalise, and Smothers have the best discussion of these two options as well as several other options.<br /></span></span> </span>

In the latter passage it refers to the bluntness of an ax that has not been sharpened.

However, Jeremiah had repeatedly warned his own generation that they were as guilty or even more so than their ancestors. The ancestors were indeed guilty of sin but the present generation had compounded the problem by their stubborn refusal to turn back to God despite repeated warnings from the prophets and hence God would withhold judgment no longer (cf. especially <ref id="19347-19350">Jer 16:10-13</ref> and compare <ref id="19144-19154, 19188-19192">Jer 7:24-34; 9:12-16</ref> (9:11-15 HT); 11:1-13).<br /></span></span>   </span>

The renewed document of Deuteronomy was written down and provisions made for periodic public reading and renewal of commitment to it (<ref id="5738-5742">Deut 31:9-13</ref>). Josiah had done this after the discovery of the book of the law (which was either Deuteronomy or a synopsis of it) early in the ministry of Jeremiah (<ref id="10167-10170">2 Kgs 23:1-4</ref>; the date would be near 622 <sc>b.c.</sc> shortly after Jeremiah began prophesying in 627 [see the note on <ref id="18949">Jer 1:2</ref>]). But it is apparent from Jeremiah&#8217;s confrontation with Judah after that time that the commitment of the people was only superficial (cf. <ref id="19013">Jer 3:10</ref>). The prior history of the nations of Israel and Judah and Judah&#8217;s current practice had been one of persistent violation of this covenant despite repeated warnings of the prophets that God would punish them for that (see especially Jer 7, 11). Because of that, Israel had been exiled (cf., e.g., <ref id="19011">Jer 3:8</ref>), and now Judah was threatened with the same (cf., e.g., <ref id="19135">Jer 7:15</ref>). Jer 30&#8211;31 look forward to a time when both Israel and Judah will be regathered, reunited, and under a new covenant which includes the same stipulations but with a different relationship (<ref id="19724">v. 32</ref>).<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H3117" data-lemma="H3117">when</span> <span class="w H2388" data-lemma="H2388">I delivered</span> them<span class="note"><span class="key">71</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;when I took them by the hand and led them out.&#8221;<br /></span></span> <span class="w H3318" data-lemma="H3318">from</span>  <span class="w H4714" data-lemma="H4714">Egypt</span>.

First is the context of the first or old covenant which was characterized by a law written on stone tablets (e.g., <ref id="2454-2455, 2498, 2525">Exod 32:15-16; 34:1, 28</ref>; <ref id="5018, 5076, 5168">Deut 4:13; 5:22; 9:10</ref>) or in a &#8220;book&#8221; or &#8220;scroll&#8221; (<ref id="5738-5742">Deut 31:9-13</ref>) which could be lost (cf. <ref id="10154">2 Kgs 22:8</ref>), forgotten (<ref id="22140">Hos 4:6</ref>), ignored (<ref id="19109">Jer 6:19</ref>; <ref id="22413">Amos 4:2</ref>), or altered (<ref id="19162">Jer 8:8</ref>). Second is the context of the repeated fault that Jeremiah has found with their stubborn (<ref id="19020, 19144, 19190, 19235, 19277, 19349, 19397, 19502">3:17; 7:24; 9:14; 11:8; 13:10; 16:12; 18:12; 23:17</ref>), uncircumcised (<ref id="19032, 19202">4:4; 9:26</ref>), and desperately wicked hearts (<ref id="19032, 19367">4:4; 17:9</ref>). Radical changes were necessary to get the people to obey the law from the heart and not just pay superficial or lip service to it (<ref id="19013, 19252">3:10; 12:2</ref>). <ref id="5710-5715">Deut 30:1-6</ref>; <ref id="20673-20676, 21384-21388">Ezek 11:17-20; 36:24-28</ref> speak of these radical changes. The <sc>Lord</sc> will remove the &#8220;foreskin&#8221; of their heart and give them a circumcised heart, or take away their &#8220;stony&#8221; heart and give them a new heart. With this heart they will be able to obey his laws, statutes, ordinances, and commands (<ref id="5717">Deut 30:8</ref>; <ref id="20676, 21387">Ezek 11:20; 36:27</ref>). The new covenant does not entail a new law; it is the same law that Jeremiah has repeatedly accused them of rejecting or ignoring (<ref id="19109, 19189, 19348, 19577, 20021">6:19; 9:13; 16:11; 26:4; 44:10</ref>). What does change is their inner commitment to keep it.

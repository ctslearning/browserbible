<h3>God's Judgment on Edom|Edom's Approaching Destruction</h3>

<span class="verse Obad_1_1" data-osis="Obad.1.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>The <span class="w H2377" data-lemma="H2377">vision</span><span class="note"><span class="key">1</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> The date of the book of Obadiah is very difficult to determine. Since there is no direct indication of chronological setting clearly suggested by the book itself, and since the historical identity of the author is uncertain as well, a possible date for the book can be arrived at only on the basis of internal evidence. When did the hostile actions of Edom against Judah that are described in this book take place? Many nineteenth-century scholars linked the events of the book to a historical note found in <ref id="9748">2 Kgs 8:20</ref> (cf. <ref id="11641-11642">2 Chr 21:16-17</ref>): &#8220;In [Jehoram&#8217;s] days Edom rebelled from under the hand of Judah and established a king over themselves.&#8221; If this is the backdrop against which Obadiah should be read, it would suggest a ninth-century <sc>b.c.</sc> date for the book, since Jehoram reigned ca. 852-841 <sc>b.c.</sc> But the evidence presented for this view is not entirely convincing, and most contemporary Old Testament scholars reject a ninth-century scenario. A more popular view, held by many biblical scholars from Luther to the present, understands the historical situation presupposed in the book to be the Babylonian invasion of Judah in the sixth century (cf. <ref id="16230">Ps 137:7</ref>; <ref id="20439-20443">Lam 4:18-22</ref>; <ref id="21096-21098, 21346-21360">Ezek 25:12-14; 35:1-15</ref>). Understood in this way, Obadiah would be describing a situation in which the Edomites assisted in the Babylonian sack of Jerusalem. Although it must be admitted that a sixth-century setting for the book of Obadiah cannot be proven, the details of the book fit reasonably well into such a context. Other views on the dating of the book, such as an eighth-century date in the time of Ahaz (ca. 732-716 <sc>b.c.</sc>) or a fifth-century date in the postexilic period, are less convincing. Parallels between the book of Obadiah and <ref id="20129-20150">Jer 49:1-22</ref> clearly suggest some kind of literary dependence, but it is not entirely clear whether Jeremiah drew on Obadiah or whether Obadiah drew upon Jeremiah, In any case, the close relationship between Obadiah and Jer 49 might suggest the sixth-century setting.<br /></span></span>   that <span class="w H5662" data-lemma="H5662">Obadiah</span><span class="note"><span class="key">2</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> The name <i>Obadiah</i> in Hebrew means &#8220;servant of the <sc>Lord</sc>.&#8221; A dozen or so individuals in the OT have this name, none of whom may be safely identified with the author of this book.

The implied answer to these rhetorical questions is &#8220;yes.&#8221; The fact that something would have remained after the imagined acts of theft or harvest stands in stark contrast to the totality of Edom&#8217;s destruction as predicted by Obadiah. Edom will be so decimated as a result of God&#8217;s judgment that nothing at all will be left<br /><b>sn</b> According to the Mosaic law, harvesters were required to leave some grain behind in the fields for the poor (<ref id="3291, 3425">Lev 19:9; 23:22</ref>; see also Ruth 2); there was a similar practice with grapes and olives (<ref id="3292">Lev 19:10</ref>; <ref id="5547">Deut 24:21</ref>). Regarding gleanings left behind from grapes, see <ref id="6722">Judg 8:2</ref>; <ref id="19099, 20137">Jer 6:9; 49:9</ref>; <ref id="22666">Mic 7:1</ref>.<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H349" data-lemma="H349">But</span> you will be <span class="t1">totally</span> <span class="w H1820" data-lemma="H1820">destroyed!</span><span class="note"><span class="key">25</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;O how you will be cut off.&#8221; This emotional interjection functions rhetorically as the prophet&#8217;s announcement of judgment on Edom. In Hebrew this statement actually appears between the first and second metaphors, that is, in the middle of this verse. As the point of the comparison, one would expect it to follow both of the two metaphors; however, Obadiah interrupts his own sentence to interject his emphatic exclamation that cannot wait until the end of the sentence. This emphatic sentence structure is eloquent in Hebrew but awkward in English. Since this emphatic assertion is the point of his comparison, it appears at the end of the sentence in this translation, where one normally expects to find the concluding point of a metaphorical comparison.<br /></span></span>   </span>

Each prohibition alludes to something that Edom did to Judah that should not have been done by one &#8220;brother&#8221; to another. It is because of these violations that the Lord has initiated judgment against Edom. In the Hebrew text these prohibitions are expressed by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>, &#8220;not&#8221;) plus the jussive form of the verb, which is common in negative commands of immediate urgency. Such constructions would normally have the sense of prohibiting something either not yet begun (i.e., &#8220;do not start to &#8230;&#8221;) or something already in process at the time of speaking (i.e., &#8220;stop&#8230;&#8221;). Here, however, it seems more likely that the prohibitions refer to a situation in past rather than future time (i.e., &#8220;you should not have &#8230;&#8221;).

<span class="verse Obad_1_16" data-osis="Obad.1.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="w H3588" data-lemma="H3588">For</span> <span class="w H834" data-lemma="H834">just</span> as you<span class="note"><span class="key">78</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The identification of the referent of &#8220;you&#8221; in <ref id="22527">v. 16</ref>a is uncertain. There are three major options: (1) On the surface, it would appear to be Edom, which is addressed in <ref id="22526">v. 15</ref>b and throughout the prophecy. However, when Edom is addressed, second person singular forms are normally used in the Hebrew. In <ref id="22527">v. 16</ref>a the Hebrew verb &#8220;you drank&#8221; is a plural form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sh&#255;titem</font>), perhaps suggesting that Edom is no longer addressed, at least solely. Perhaps Edom and the nations, mentioned in <ref id="22526">v. 15</ref>a, are both addressed in <ref id="22527">v. 16</ref>a. However, since the nations are referred to in the third person in <ref id="22527">v. 16</ref>b, it seems unlikely that they are addressed here. (2) Another option is to take the final <font face="Scholar">mem</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1501;</font>) on the Hebrew verb form (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1462;&#1501;</font>) as an enclitic particle and revocalize the form as a singular verb (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1464;</font>, <font face="Scholar">shatita</font>) addressed to Edom. In this case <ref id="22527">v. 16</ref>a would allude to the time when Edom celebrated Jerusalem&#8217;s defeat on Mount Zion, God&#8217;s &#8220;holy hill.&#8221; Verse 16b would then make the ironic point that just as Edom once drank in victory, so the nations (Edom included) would someday drink the cup of judgment. However, this interpretation is problematic for it necessitates taking the drinking metaphor in different ways (as signifying celebration and then judgment) within the same verse. (3) Another option is that the exiled people of Judah are addressed. Just as God&#8217;s people were forced to drink the intoxicating wine of divine judgment, so the nations, including those who humiliated Judah, would be forced to drink this same wine. However, the problem here is that God&#8217;s people are never addressed elsewhere in the prophecy, making this approach problematic as well.<br /></span></span>  have <span class="w H8354" data-lemma="H8354">drunk</span><span class="note"><span class="key">79</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> This reference to drinking portrays the profane activities of those who had violated Jerusalem&#8217;s sanctity.

This extended metaphor is paralleled in <ref id="20140">Jer 49:12</ref> which describes God&#8217;s imminent judgment on Edom, &#8220;If even those who did not deserve to drink from the cup of my wrath have to drink from it, do you think you will go unpunished? You will not go unpunished, but you also will certainly drink from the cup of my wrath.&#8221; There are numerous parallels between Obadiah and the oracle against Edom in <ref id="20129-20150">Jer 49:1-22</ref>, so perhaps the latter should be used to help understand the enigmatic metaphor here in <ref id="22527">v. 16</ref>.<br /></span></span>   They will <span class="w H8354" data-lemma="H8354">drink</span>,  and they will <span class="w H3886" data-lemma="H3886">gulp down;</span> they will <span class="w H1961" data-lemma="H1961">be</span> as though they had <span class="w H3808" data-lemma="H3808">never</span> <span class="w H1961" data-lemma="H1961">been</span>.  </span>

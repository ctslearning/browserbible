<h3>The Materials for the Sanctuary</h3>

There is some question about the etymology of the word. The traditional meaning of &#8220;heave-offering&#8221; derives from the idea of &#8220;elevation,&#8221; a root meaning &#8220;to be high&#8221; lying behind the word. B. Jacob says it is something sorted out of a mass of material and designated for a higher purpose (<i>Exodus</i>, 765). S. R. Driver (<i>Exodus</i>, 263) corrects the idea of &#8220;heave-offering&#8221; by relating the root to the Hiphil form of that root, <i>herim</i>, &#8220;to lift&#8221; or &#8220;take off.&#8221; He suggests the noun means &#8220;what is taken off&#8221; from a larger mass and so designated for sacred purposes. The LXX has &#8220;something taken off.&#8221;<br /></span></span>   for me; from <span class="w H3605" data-lemma="H3605">every</span> <span class="w H376" data-lemma="H376">person</span> <span class="w H834" data-lemma="H834">motivated</span> by a <span class="w H5068" data-lemma="H5068">willing</span><span class="note"><span class="key">4</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1491;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1462;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yidd&#255;vennu</font>) is related to the word for the &#8220;freewill offering&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1456;&#1491;&#1464;&#1489;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">n&#255;davah</font>).

The Arabic <font face="Scholar">tuhas</font> or <font face="Scholar">duhas</font> is a dolphin, and so some think a sea animal is meant &#8211; something like a dolphin or porpoise (cf. NASB; ASV &#8220;sealskins&#8221;; NIV &#8220;hides of sea cows&#8221;). Porpoises are common in the Red Sea; their skins are used for clothing by the bedouin. The word has also been connected to an Egyptian word for &#8220;leather&#8221; (<font face="Scholar">ths</font>); see S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, 265. Some variation of this is followed by NRSV (&#8220;fine leather&#8221;) and NLT (&#8220;fine goatskin leather&#8221;). Another suggestion connects this word to an Akkadian one that describes a precious stone that is yellow or ornge and also leather died with the color of this stone (N. M. Sarna, <i>Exodus</i> [JPSTC], 157-58).<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H7848" data-lemma="H7848">acacia</span><span class="note"><span class="key">14</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> The wood of the acacia is darker and harder than oak, and so very durable.<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H6086" data-lemma="H6086">wood</span>,  </span>

The word rendered &#8220;pattern&#8221; is related to the verb &#8220;to build&#8221;; it suggests a model. S. R. Driver notes that in ancient literature there is the account of Gudea receiving in a dream a complete model of a temple he was to erect (<i>Exodus</i>, 267). In this passage Moses is being shown something on the mountain that should be the pattern of the earthly sanctuary. The most plausible explanation of what he was shown comes from a correlation with comments in the Letter to the Hebrews and the book of Revelation, which describe the heavenly sanctuary as the true sanctuary, and the earthly as the copy or shadow. One could say that Moses was allowed to see what John saw on the island of Patmos, a vision of the heavenly sanctuary. That still might not explain what it was, but it would mean he saw a revelation of the true tent, and that would imply that he learned of the spiritual and eternal significance of all of it. The fact that Israel&#8217;s sanctuary resembled those of other cultures does not nullify this act of revelation; rather, it raises the question of where the other nations got their ideas if it was not made known early in human history. One can conclude that in the beginning there was much more revealed to the parents in the garden than Scripture tells about (Cain and Abel did know how to make sacrifices before Leviticus legislated it). Likewise, one cannot but guess at the influence of the fallen Satan and his angels in the world of pagan religion. Whatever the source, at Sinai God shows the true, and instructs that it all be done without the pagan corruptions and additions. U. Cassuto notes that the existence of these ancient parallels shows that the section on the tabernacle need not be dated in the second temple period, but fits the earlier period well (<i>Exodus</i>, 324).<br /></span></span>   and <span class="w H853" data-lemma="H853">the</span> <span class="w H8403" data-lemma="H8403">pattern</span> of <span class="w H3605" data-lemma="H3605">all</span> its <span class="w H3627" data-lemma="H3627">furnishings</span>–  you<span class="note"><span class="key">19</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The pronoun is plural.<br /></span></span>  must <span class="w H6213" data-lemma="H6213">make</span> it <span class="w H3651" data-lemma="H3651">exactly</span> so.<span class="note"><span class="key">20</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> Among the many helpful studies on the tabernacle, include S.

Driver (<i>Exodus</i>, 272) makes the point that the verb here is not the word that means &#8220;to meet by chance&#8221; (as in <ref id="1598">Exod 3:18</ref>), but &#8220;to meet&#8221; by appointment for a purpose (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1504;&#1493;&#1465;&#1506;&#1463;&#1491;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font>, <font face="Scholar">v&#255;no</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">adti</font>).

The breakdown for exposition could be the instructions for preparation for light (one lamp, several branches), then instructions for the purpose and maintenance of the lamps, and then the last verse telling the divine source for the instructions. Naturally, the metaphorical value of light will come up in the study, especially from the NT. So in the NT there is the warning that if churches are unfaithful God will remove their lampstand, their ministry (Rev 2-3).<br /></span></span>    </span>

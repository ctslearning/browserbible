<h3>The Source of Sufficiency</h3>

At the hesitancy of Moses, God guarantees his presence will be with him, and that assures the success of the mission. But with chap. 4, the second half of the call, the tone changes sharply. Now Moses protests his inadequacies in view of the nature of the task. In many ways, these verses address the question, &#8220;Who is sufficient for these things?&#8221; There are three basic movements in the passage. The first nine verses tell how God gave Moses signs in case Israel did not believe him (<ref id="1603-1611">4:1-9</ref>). The second section records how God dealt with the speech problem of Moses (<ref id="1612-1614">4:10-12</ref>). And finally, the last section records God&#8217;s provision of a helper, someone who could talk well (<ref id="1615-1619">4:13-17</ref>). See also J. E. Hamlin, &#8220;The Liberator&#8217;s Ordeal: A Study of <ref id="1603-1611">Exodus 4:1-9</ref>,&#8221; <i>Rhetorical Criticism</i> [PTMS], 33-42.<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H6030" data-lemma="H6030">answered</span> <span class="t1">again,<span class="note"><span class="key">2</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and Moses answered and said.&#8221;<br /></span></span> </span> “And <span class="w H2005" data-lemma="H2005">if</span><span class="note"><span class="key">3</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;What if.&#8221; The use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1461;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hen</font>) is unusual here, introducing a conditional idea in the question without a following consequence clause (see <ref id="1733">Exod 8:22</ref> HT [<ref id="1737">8:26</ref> ET]; <ref id="18976">Jer 2:10</ref>; <ref id="11338">2 Chr 7:13</ref>).

This would place Moses&#8217; returning to Egypt near 1450 <sc>b.c.,</sc> in the beginning of the reign of Amenhotep II, whom most conservatives identify as the pharaoh of the exodus. Rameses II, of course, had a very long reign (1304-1236). But if he were the one from whom Moses fled, then he could not be the pharaoh of the exodus, but his son would be &#8211; and that puts the date of the exodus after 1236, a date too late for anyone.

God had said that if Pharaoh would not comply he would kill his son &#8211; but now God was ready to kill Moses, the representative of Israel, God&#8217;s own son. Apparently, one would reconstruct that on the journey Moses fell seriously ill, but his wife, learning the cause of the illness, saved his life by circumcising her son and casting the foreskin at Moses&#8217; feet (indicating that it was symbolically Moses&#8217; foreskin). The point is that this son of Abraham had not complied with the sign of the Abrahamic covenant. No one, according to <ref id="1857-1868">Exod 12:40-51</ref>, would take part in the Passover-exodus who had not complied. So how could the one who was going to lead God&#8217;s people not comply? The bold anthropomorphisms and the location at the border invite comparisons with Gen 32, the Angel wrestling with Jacob. In both cases there is a brush with death that could not be forgotten.

The phrase explains that the saying was in reference to the act of circumcision. Some scholars speculate that there was a ritual prior to marriage from which this event and its meaning derived. But it appears rather that if there was some ancient ritual, it would have had to come from this event. The difficulty is that the son is circumcised, not Moses, making the comparative mythological view untenable. Moses had apparently not circumcised Eliezer. Since Moses was taking his family with him, God had to make sure the sign of the covenant was kept. It may be that here Moses sent them all back to Jethro (<ref id="2002">18:2</ref>) because of the difficulties that lay ahead.<br /></span></span>  the <span class="w H4139" data-lemma="H4139">circumcision</span>.)   </span>

It means that God intervened in the life of the Israelites to bless them with the fulfillment of the promises. It says more than that he took notice of them, took pity on them, or remembered them.

The implication is certainly that they prayed, or praised, and performed some other aspect of worship, but the text may just be describing it from their posture of worship. With this response, all the fears of Moses are swept aside &#8211; they believed and they were thankful to God.<br /></span></span> </span>

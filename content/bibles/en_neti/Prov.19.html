However, the MT makes sense as it stands; this is an example of metonymical parallelism. The MT reading is also supported by the LXX.

In light of the synonymous parallelism, the most likely nuance here is &#8220;zeal, passion&#8221; (<i>HALOT</i> 713 s.<ref id="16934">v. 8</ref>).

The preceding two lines are loosely synonymous in their parallelism, but the third adds something like: &#8220;he pursues [them with] words, but they [do] not [respond].&#8221; Some simply say it is a corrupt remnant of a separate proverb and beyond restoration. The basic idea does make sense, though. The idea of his family and friends rejecting the poor person reveals how superficial they are, and how they make themselves scarce. Since they are far off, he has to look for them &#8220;with words&#8221; (adverbial accusative), that is, &#8220;send word&#8221; for help. But they &#8220;are nowhere to be found&#8221; (so NIV). The LXX reads &#8220;will not be delivered&#8221; in place of &#8220;not they&#8221; &#8211; clearly an attempt to make sense out of the cryptic phrase, and, in the process, showing evidence for that text.<br /></span></span>   </span>

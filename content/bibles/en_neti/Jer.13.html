The latter is more accurate according to J. M. Myers, &#8220;Dress and Ornaments,&#8221; <i>IDB</i> <ref id="99999">1:870</ref>, and W. L. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah</i> (Hermeneia), <ref id="99999">1:399</ref>. It was a short, skirt-like garment reaching from the waist to the knees and worn next to the body (cf. <ref id="19276">v. 9</ref>). The modern equivalent is &#8220;shorts&#8221; as in TEV/GNB, CEV.<br /><br/></br><b>sn</b> The <i>linen shorts</i> (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;loincloth&#8221;) were representative of Israel and the wearing of them was to illustrate the <sc>Lord</sc>&#8217;s close relation to his people (<ref id="19278">v. 11</ref>). Since the priests&#8217; garments were to be made wholly of linen (cf. Exod 28; <ref id="21617-21618">Ezek 44:17-18</ref>), the fact that the shorts were to be made of linen probably was to symbolize the nature of Israel&#8217;s calling: they were to be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation (<ref id="2032-2033">Exod 19:5-6</ref>). Just as the linen garments of the priest were to give him special honor and glory (<ref id="2334">Exod 28:40</ref>), so the linen garment was to be a source of praise and glory to the <sc>Lord</sc> (<ref id="19278">v. 11</ref>).<br /></span></span>   and <span class="w H7760" data-lemma="H7760">put</span> them <span class="w H4975 H5921" data-lemma="H4975 H5921">on</span>.<span class="note"><span class="key">2</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;upon your loins.&#8221; The &#8220;loins&#8221; were the midriff of the body from the waist to the knees.

A possible explanation within the context is that it was to be worn continuously, not even taken off to wash it. That would illustrate that the close relationship that the <sc>Lord</sc> had with his people was continuous and indissoluble. Other explanations are that it was not to be gotten wet because (1) that would have begun the process of rotting (This assumes that the rotting was done by the water of the Euphrates. But it was buried in a crack in the rocks, not in the river itself); (2) that would have made it softer and easier to wear; or (3) that showed that the garment was new, clean, and fresh from the merchant. For this latter interpretation see J. A. Thompson, <i>Jeremiah</i> (NICOT), 64. For a fuller discussion of most of the issues connected with this acted out parable see W. McKane, <i>Jeremiah</i> (ICC), <ref id="1-1">1:285-92</ref>. However, the reason is not explained in the text and there is not enough evidence in the text to come to a firm conclusion, though the most likely possibility is that it was not to be taken off and washed but worn continuously.<br /></span></span>   </span>

Elsewhere the word &#8220;Perath&#8221; always refers to the Euphrates but it is either preceded by the word &#8220;river of&#8221; or there is contextual indication that the Euphrates is being referred to. Because a journey to the Euphrates and back would involve a journey of more than 700 miles (1,100 km) and take some months, scholars both ancient and modern have questioned whether &#8220;Perath&#8221; refers to the Euphrates here and if it does whether a real journey was involved. Most of the attempts to identify the place with the Euphrates involve misguided assumptions that this action was a symbolic message to Israel about exile or the corrupting influence of Assyria and Babylon. However, unlike the other symbolic acts in Jeremiah (and in Isaiah and Ezekiel) the symbolism is not part of a message to the people but to Jeremiah; the message is explained to him (<ref id="19276-19278">vv. 9-11</ref>) not the people. In keeping with some of the wordplays that are somewhat common in Jeremiah it is likely that the reference here is to a place, Parah, which was near Jeremiah&#8217;s hometown, but whose name would naturally suggest to Jeremiah later in the <sc>Lord</sc>&#8217;s explanation in <ref id="19276-19278">vv. 9-11</ref> Assyria-Babylon as a place connected with Judah&#8217;s corruption (see the notes on <ref id="19276-19277">vv. 9-10</ref>). For further discussion the reader should consult the commentaries, especially W. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah</i> (Hermeneia), <ref id="99999">1:396</ref> and W. McKane, <i>Jeremiah</i> (ICC), <ref id="1-1">1:285-92</ref> who take opposite positions on this issue.<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H2934" data-lemma="H2934">Bury</span> the <span class="t1">shorts</span> <span class="w H8033" data-lemma="H8033">there</span><span class="note"><span class="key">10</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> The significance of this act is explained in <ref id="19276-19277">vv. 9-10</ref>.

However, BDB 144-45 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> 1 is more probably correct when they classify this passage among those that deal with the &#8220;&#8216;<i>majesty, excellence</i>&#8217; of nations, their wealth, power, magnificence of buildings&#8230;.&#8221; The closest parallels to the usage here are in <ref id="23028">Zech 10:11</ref> (parallel to scepter of Egypt); <ref id="14630">Ps 47:4</ref> (<ref id="20079">47:5</ref> HT; parallel to &#8220;our heritage&#8221; = &#8220;our land&#8221;); <ref id="17940">Isa 14:11</ref>; and <ref id="22489">Amos 8:7</ref>. The term is further defined in <ref id="19278">v. 11</ref> where it refers to their special relationship and calling. To translate it &#8220;pride&#8221; or &#8220;arrogance&#8221; also ruins the wordplay on &#8220;ruin&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1495;&#1463;&#1514;</font> [<font face="Scholar">nishkhat</font>] in <ref id="19274">v. 7</ref> and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1495;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ashkhit</font>] in <ref id="19276">v. 9</ref>).<br /><br/></br><b>sn</b> Scholars ancient and modern are divided over the significance of the statement <i>I will ruin the highly exalted position in which Judah and Jerusalem take pride</i> (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will ruin the pride of Judah and Jerusalem&#8221;). Some feel that it refers to the corrupting influence of Assyria and Babylon and others feel that it refers to the threat of Babylonian exile. However, F. B. Huey (<i>Jeremiah, Lamentations</i> [NAC], 144) is correct in observing that the Babylonian exile did not lead to the rottenness of Judah, the corrupting influence of the foreign nations did. In Jeremiah&#8217;s day these came through the age-old influences of the Canaanite worship of Baal but also the astral worship introduced by Ahaz and Manasseh. For an example of the corrupting influence of Assyria on Judah through Ahaz&#8217;s political alliances see 2 Kgs 16 and also compare the allegory in <ref id="21022-21029">Ezek 23:14-21</ref>. It was while the &#8220;linen shorts&#8221; were off Jeremiah&#8217;s body and buried in the rocks that the linen shorts were ruined. So the <sc>Lord</sc> &#8220;ruined&#8221; the privileged status that resulted from Israel&#8217;s close relationship to him (cf. <ref id="19278">v. 11</ref>). For the &#8220;problem&#8221; created by the <sc>Lord</sc> ruining Israel through corrupting influence compare the notes on <ref id="19038">Jer 4:10</ref> and compare also passages like <ref id="18884">Isa 63:17</ref> and <ref id="17780">Isa 6:10</ref>.<br /></span></span>  in which <span class="w H3063" data-lemma="H3063">Judah</span> and <span class="w H3389" data-lemma="H3389">Jerusalem</span><span class="note"><span class="key">19</span><span class="text"><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.<br /></span></span>   take <span class="w H1347" data-lemma="H1347">pride</span>.   </span>

It is added in the Greek text and is generally considered to be the object of address because of the second feminine singular verbs here and throughout the following verses. The translation follows the consonantal text (<i>Kethib</i>) and the Greek text in reading the second feminine singular here. The verbs and pronouns in <ref id="99999-19289">vv. 20-22</ref> are all second feminine singular with the exception of the suffix on the word &#8220;eyes&#8221; which is not reflected in the translation here (&#8220;Look up&#8221; = &#8220;Lift up your eyes&#8221;) and the verb and pronoun in <ref id="19290">v. 23</ref>. The text may reflect the same kind of alternation between singular and plural that takes place in Isa 7 where the pronouns refer to Ahaz as an individual and his entourage, the contemporary ruling class (cf., e.g., <ref id="17787-17788">Isa 7:4-5</ref> [singular], 9 [plural], 11 [singular], 13-14 [plural]). Here the connection with the preceding may suggest that it is initially the ruling house (the king and the queen mother), then Jerusalem personified as a woman in her role as a shepherdess (i.e., leader). However, from elsewhere in the book the leadership has included the kings, the priests, the prophets, and the citizens as well (cf., e.g., <ref id="19280">13:13</ref>). In <ref id="19294">v. 27</ref> Jerusalem is explicitly addressed. It may be asking too much of some readers who are not familiar with biblical metaphors to understand an extended metaphor like this.

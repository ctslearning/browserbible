<h3>The Creation of the World</h3>
<p>
<span class="verse Gen_1_1" data-osis="Gen.1.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>In the <span class="w H7225" data-lemma="H7225">beginning</span><span class="note"><span class="key">1</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The translation assumes that the form translated &#8220;beginning&#8221; is in the absolute state rather than the construct (&#8220;in the beginning of,&#8221; or &#8220;when God created&#8221;). In other words, the clause in <ref id="1">v. 1</ref> is a main clause, <ref id="2">v. 2</ref> has three clauses that are descriptive and supply background information, and <ref id="3">v. 3</ref> begins the narrative sequence proper. The referent of the word &#8220;beginning&#8221; has to be defined from the context since there is no beginning or ending with God.<br /><b>sn</b> <i>In the beginning</i>. The verse refers to the beginning of the world as we know it; it affirms that it is entirely the product of the creation of God. But there are two ways that this verse can be interpreted: (1) It may be taken to refer to the original act of creation with the rest of the events on the days of creation completing it. This would mean that the disjunctive clauses of <ref id="2">v. 2</ref> break the sequence of the creative work of the first day. (2) It may be taken as a summary statement of what the chapter will record, that is, <ref id="3-31">vv. 3-31</ref> are about God&#8217;s creating the world as we know it. If the first view is adopted, then we have a reference here to original creation; if the second view is taken, then Genesis itself does not account for the original creation of matter. To follow this view does not deny that the Bible teaches that God created everything out of nothing (cf. <ref id="26048">John 1:3</ref>) &#8211; it simply says that Genesis is not making that affirmation. This second view presupposes the existence of pre-existent matter, when God said, &#8220;Let there be light.&#8221; The first view includes the description of the primordial state as part of the events of day one. The following narrative strongly favors the second view, for the &#8220;heavens/sky&#8221; did not exist prior to the second day of creation (see <ref id="8">v. 8</ref>) and &#8220;earth/dry land&#8221; did not exist, at least as we know it, prior to the third day of creation (see <ref id="10">v. 10</ref>).<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H430" data-lemma="H430">God</span><span class="note"><span class="key">2</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> <i>God</i>. This frequently used Hebrew name for God (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>,&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elohim</font> ) is a plural form. When it refers to the one true God, the singular verb is normally used, as here. The plural form indicates majesty; the name stresses God&#8217;s sovereignty and incomparability &#8211; he is the &#8220;God of gods.&#8221;<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H1254" data-lemma="H1254">created</span><span class="note"><span class="key">3</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The English verb &#8220;create&#8221; captures well the meaning of the Hebrew term in this context. The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bara</font>&#8217;) always describes the divine activity of fashioning something new, fresh, and perfect. The verb does not necessarily describe creation out of nothing (see, for example, <ref id="27">v. 27</ref>, where it refers to the creation of man); it often stresses forming anew, reforming, renewing (see <ref id="14702">Ps 51:10</ref>; <ref id="18521, 18915">Isa 43:15; 65:17</ref>).<br /></span></span>   the <span class="w H8064" data-lemma="H8064">heavens</span> and <span class="w H853" data-lemma="H853">the</span> <span class="w H776" data-lemma="H776">earth</span>.<span class="note"><span class="key">4</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;the entire universe&#8221;; or &#8220;the sky and the dry land.&#8221; This phrase is often interpreted as a merism, referring to the entire ordered universe, including the heavens and the earth and everything in them. The &#8220;heavens and the earth&#8221; were completed in seven days (see <ref id="32">Gen 2:1</ref>) and are characterized by fixed laws (see <ref id="19801">Jer 33:25</ref>). &#8220;Heavens&#8221; refers specifically to the sky, created on the second day (see <ref id="8">v. 8</ref>), while &#8220;earth&#8221; refers specifically to the dry land, created on the third day (see <ref id="10">v. 10</ref>). Both are distinct from the sea/seas (see <ref id="10">v. 10</ref> and <ref id="2063">Exod 20:11</ref>).<br /></span></span>   </span>

<span class="verse Gen_1_2" data-osis="Gen.1.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Now<span class="note"><span class="key">5</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The disjunctive clause (conjunction + subject + verb) at the beginning of <ref id="2">v. 2</ref> gives background information for the following narrative, explaining the state of things when &#8220;God said&#8230;&#8221; (<ref id="3">v. 3</ref>). Verse one is a title to the chapter, <ref id="2">v. 2</ref> provides information about the state of things when God spoke, and <ref id="3">v. 3</ref> begins the narrative per se with the typical narrative construction (<i>vav</i> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>] consecutive followed by the prefixed verbal form). (This literary structure is paralleled in the second portion of the book: <ref id="35">Gen 2:4</ref> provides the title or summary of what follows, <ref id="36-37">2:5-6</ref> use disjunctive clause structures to give background information for the following narrative, and <ref id="38">2:7</ref> begins the narrative with the <i>vav</i> consecutive attached to a prefixed verbal form.) Some translate <ref id="2">1:2</ref>a &#8220;and the earth became,&#8221; arguing that <ref id="1">v. 1</ref> describes the original creation of the earth, while <ref id="2">v. 2</ref> refers to a judgment that reduced it to a chaotic condition. Verses 3ff. then describe the re-creation of the earth. However, the disjunctive clause at the beginning of <ref id="2">v. 2</ref> cannot be translated as if it were relating the next event in a sequence. If <ref id="2">v. 2</ref> were sequential to <ref id="1">v. 1</ref>, the author would have used the <i>vav</i> consecutive followed by a prefixed verbal form and the subject.<br /></span></span>  the <span class="w H776" data-lemma="H776">earth</span><span class="note"><span class="key">6</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> That is, what we now call &#8220;the earth.&#8221; The creation of the earth as we know it is described in <ref id="9-10">vv. 9-10</ref>.

What we now know as &#8220;the earth&#8221; was actually an unfilled mass covered by water and darkness. Later <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1465;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tohu</font>) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1465;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bohu</font>), when used in proximity, describe a situation resulting from judgment (<ref id="18315">Isa 34:11</ref>; <ref id="19051">Jer 4:23</ref>). Both prophets may be picturing judgment as the reversal of creation in which God&#8217;s judgment causes the world to revert to its primordial condition. This later use of the terms has led some to conclude that <ref id="2">Gen 1:2</ref> presupposes the judgment of a prior world, but it is unsound method to read the later application of the imagery (in a context of judgment) back into <ref id="2">Gen 1:2</ref>.<br /></span></span>   and <span class="w H2822" data-lemma="H2822">darkness</span><span class="note"><span class="key">8</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> <i>Darkness</i>. The Hebrew word simply means &#8220;darkness,&#8221; but in the Bible it has come to symbolize what opposes God, such as judgment (<ref id="1799">Exod 10:21</ref>), death (<ref id="15322">Ps 88:13</ref>), oppression (<ref id="17831">Isa 9:1</ref>), the wicked (<ref id="7250">1 Sam 2:9</ref>) and in general, sin. In <ref id="18569">Isa 45:7</ref> it parallels &#8220;evil.&#8221; It is a fitting cover for the primeval waste, but it prepares the reader for the fact that God is about to reveal himself through his works.<br /></span></span>   was <span class="w H5921" data-lemma="H5921">over</span> the <span class="w H6440" data-lemma="H6440">surface</span> of the watery <span class="w H8415" data-lemma="H8415">deep</span>,<span class="note"><span class="key">9</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">t&#255;hom</font>, &#8220;deep&#8221;) refers to the watery deep, the salty ocean &#8211; especially the primeval ocean that surrounds and underlies the earth (see <ref id="171">Gen 7:11</ref>).<br /><b>sn</b> <i>The watery deep</i>. In the Babylonian account of creation Marduk killed the goddess Tiamat (the salty sea) and used her carcass to create heaven and earth. The form of the Hebrew word for &#8220;deep&#8221; is distinct enough from the name &#8220;Tiamat&#8221; to deny direct borrowing; however, it is possible that there is a polemical stress here. Ancient Israel does not see the ocean as a powerful deity to be destroyed in creation, only a force of nature that can be controlled by God.<br /></span></span>   but the <span class="w H7307" data-lemma="H7307">Spirit</span> of <span class="w H430" data-lemma="H430">God</span><span class="note"><span class="key">10</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The traditional rendering &#8220;Spirit of God&#8221; is preserved here, as opposed to a translation like &#8220;wind from/breath of God&#8221; (cf. NRSV) or &#8220;mighty wind&#8221; (cf. NEB), taking the word &#8220;God&#8221; to represent the superlative. Elsewhere in the OT the phrase refers consistently to the divine spirit that empowers and energizes individuals (see <ref id="1234">Gen 41:38</ref>; <ref id="2424, 2563">Exod 31:3; 35:31</ref>; <ref id="4449">Num 24:2</ref>; <ref id="7429, 7452, 7727, 7730">1 Sam 10:10; 11:6; 19:20, 23</ref>; <ref id="20680">Ezek 11:24</ref>; <ref id="11492, 11698">2 Chr 15:1; 24:20</ref>).<br /></span></span>   was <span class="w H7363" data-lemma="H7363">moving</span><span class="note"><span class="key">11</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The Hebrew verb has been translated &#8220;hovering&#8221; or &#8220;moving&#8221; (as a bird over her young, see <ref id="5770">Deut 32:11</ref>). The Syriac cognate term means &#8220;to brood over; to incubate.&#8221; How much of that sense might be attached here is hard to say, but the verb does depict the presence of the Spirit of God moving about mysteriously over the waters, presumably preparing for the acts of creation to follow. If one reads &#8220;mighty wind&#8221; (cf. NEB) then the verse describes how the powerful wind begins to blow in preparation for the creative act described in <ref id="9-10">vv. 9-10</ref>. (God also used a wind to drive back the flood waters in Noah&#8217;s day. See <ref id="185">Gen 8:1</ref>.)<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H5921" data-lemma="H5921">over</span> the <span class="w H6440" data-lemma="H6440">surface</span><span class="note"><span class="key">12</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;face.&#8221;<br /></span></span>   of the <span class="w H4325" data-lemma="H4325">water</span>.<span class="note"><span class="key">13</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> <i>The water</i>. The text deliberately changes now from the term for the watery deep to the general word for water. The arena is now the life-giving water and not the chaotic abyss-like deep.

The deep carries with it the sense of the abyss, chaos, darkness &#8211; in short, that which is not good for life.<br /></span></span>   </span>

In Leviticus God separates between clean and unclean, holy and profane (<ref id="2988, 3045">Lev 10:10; 11:47</ref> and <ref id="3343">20:24</ref>); in Exodus God separates the Holy Place from the Most Holy Place (<ref id="2269">Exod 26:33</ref>).

Seven times in this chapter naming or blessing follows some act of creation. There is clearly a point being made beyond the obvious idea of naming. In the Babylonian creation story <i>Enuma Elish,</i> naming is equal to creating. In the Bible the act of naming, like creating, can be an indication of sovereignty (see <ref id="10200">2 Kgs 23:34</ref>).

Another alternative would be to translate, &#8220;There was night and then there was day, one day.&#8221;<br /><b>sn</b> <i>The first day</i>. The exegetical evidence suggests the word &#8220;day&#8221; in this chapter refers to a literal twenty-four hour day. It is true that the word can refer to a longer period of time (see <ref id="18846">Isa 61:2</ref>, or the idiom in <ref id="35">2:4</ref>, &#8220;in the day,&#8221; that is, &#8220;when&#8221;).

Also, when the Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yom</font>) is used with a numerical adjective, it refers to a literal day. Furthermore, the commandment to keep the sabbath clearly favors this interpretation. One is to work for six days and then rest on the seventh, just as God did when he worked at creation.<br /></span></span>    </span>

Many Christian theologians interpret it as an early hint of plurality within the Godhead, but this view imposes later trinitarian concepts on the ancient text. Some have suggested the plural verb indicates majesty, but the plural of majesty is not used with verbs. C. Westermann (<i>Genesis</i>, <ref id="99999">1:145</ref>) argues for a plural of &#8220;deliberation&#8221; here, but his proposed examples of this use (<ref id="8707">2 Sam 24:14</ref>; <ref id="17778">Isa 6:8</ref>) do not actually support his theory. In <ref id="8707">2 Sam 24:14</ref> David uses the plural as representative of all Israel, and in <ref id="17778">Isa 6:8</ref> the <sc>Lord</sc> speaks on behalf of his heavenly court. In its ancient Israelite context the plural is most naturally understood as referring to God and his heavenly court (see <ref id="9500-9503">1 Kgs 22:19-22</ref>; <ref id="12876-12882, 12893-12898">Job 1:6-12; 2:1-6</ref>; <ref id="17771-17778">Isa 6:1-8</ref>). (The most well-known members of this court are God&#8217;s messengers, or angels. In <ref id="61">Gen <ref id="61">3:5</ref></ref> the serpent may refer to this group as &#8220;gods/divine beings.&#8221; See the note on the word &#8220;evil&#8221; in 3:5.) If this is the case, God invites the heavenly court to participate in the creation of humankind (perhaps in the role of offering praise, see <ref id="13801">Job 38:7</ref>), but he himself is the one who does the actual creative work (<ref id="27">v. 27</ref>). Of course, this view does assume that the members of the heavenly court possess the divine &#8220;image&#8221; in some way. Since the image is closely associated with rulership, perhaps they share the divine image in that they, together with God and under his royal authority, are the executive authority over the world.<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H120" data-lemma="H120">humankind</span><span class="note"><span class="key">48</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">adam</font>), which can sometimes refer to man, as opposed to woman. The term refers here to humankind, comprised of male and female. The singular is clearly collective (see the plural verb, &#8220;[that] they may rule&#8221; in <ref id="26">v. 26</ref>b) and the referent is defined specifically as &#8220;male and female&#8221; in <ref id="27">v. 27</ref>.

The form is more likely stressing the spiritual rather than the physical. The &#8220;image of God&#8221; would be the God-given mental and spiritual capacities that enable people to relate to God and to serve him by ruling over the created order as his earthly vice-regents.<br /><b>sn</b> <i>In our image, after our likeness</i>.

Bildad cannot even imagine saying that God is unjust. The only conclusion open to him is that Job&#8217;s family brought this on themselves, and so the only recourse is for Job to humble himself and make supplication to God. To make his point, Bildad will appeal to the wisdom of the ancients, for his theology is traditional. The speech has three parts: <ref id="13032-13037">vv. 2-7</ref> form his affirmation of the justice of God; <ref id="13038-13049">vv. 8-19</ref> are his appeal to the wisdom of the ancients, and <ref id="99999-13052">vv. 20-22</ref> are his summation. See N. C. Habel, &#8220;Appeal to Ancient Tradition as a Literary Form,&#8221; <i>ZAW</i> 88 (1976): 253-72; W. A. Irwin, &#8220;The First Speech of Bildad,&#8221; <i>ZAW</i> 51 (1953): 205-16.<br /></span></span>  seeing<span class="note"><span class="key">2</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> &#8220;These things&#8221; refers to all of Job&#8217;s speech, the general drift of which seems to Bildad to question the justice of God.<br /></span></span>  that the <span class="w H561" data-lemma="H561">words</span> of your <span class="w H6310" data-lemma="H6310">mouth</span> are like a <span class="w H3524" data-lemma="H3524">great</span><span class="note"><span class="key">3</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The second colon of the verse simply says &#8220;and a strong wind the words of your mouth.&#8221; The simplest way to treat this is to make it an independent nominal sentence: &#8220;the words of your mouth <i>are</i> a strong wind.&#8221; Some have made it parallel to the first by apposition, understanding &#8220;how long&#8221; to do double duty. The line beginning with the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vav</font>) can also be subordinated as a circumstantial clause, as here.<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H7307" data-lemma="H7307">wind</span>?<span class="note"><span class="key">4</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kabbir</font>, &#8220;great&#8221;) implies both abundance and greatness. Here the word modifies &#8220;wind&#8221;; the point of the analogy is that Job&#8217;s words are full of sound but without solid content.<br /></span></span>   </span>

It can mean an act of judgment, place of judgment, or what is just, that is, the outcome of the decision. It basically describes an umpire&#8217;s decision. The parallel word is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1462;&#1491;&#1462;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsedeq</font>, &#8220;righteousness,&#8221; or &#8220;what is right&#8221;). The basic idea here is that which conforms to the standard, what is right. See S. H.

J. A. Clines, <i>Job</i> [WBC], 198). The repetition in the Hebrew text is a common type; it strengthens the enormity of the charge Job seems to be making.<br /></span></span>   your <span class="w H1121" data-lemma="H1121">children</span> <span class="w H2398" data-lemma="H2398">sinned</span> against him, he <span class="w H7971" data-lemma="H7971">gave</span> them over<span class="note"><span class="key">9</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The AV and RV take the protasis down to the middle of <ref id="13036">v. 6</ref>. The LXX changes the &#8220;if&#8221; at the beginning of <ref id="13035">v. 5</ref> to &#8220;then&#8221; and makes that verse the apodosis. If the apodosis comes in the second half of <ref id="13034">v. 4</ref>, then <ref id="13034">v. 4</ref> would be a complete sentence (H. H. Rowley, <i>Job</i> [NCBC], 71; A. B. Davidson, <i>Job</i>, 60). The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>) has the sense of &#8220;since&#8221; in this section.<br /></span></span>  to the <span class="w H3027" data-lemma="H3027">penalty</span><span class="note"><span class="key">10</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The verb is a Piel preterite with a <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive. The <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vav</font>) need not be translated if the second half of the verse is the apodosis of the first &#8211; since they sinned&#8230;he did this. The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1461;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shilleakh</font>) means &#8220;to expel; to thrust out&#8221; normally; here the sense of &#8220;deliver up&#8221; or &#8220;deliver over&#8221; fits the sentence well. The verse is saying that sin carries its own punishment, and so God merely delivered the young people over to it.<br /></span></span>   of their <span class="w H6588" data-lemma="H6588">sin</span>.  </span>

With the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el</font>) the verb may carry the nuance of &#8220;to address; to have recourse to&#8221; (see E.

The LXX connected it etymologically to &#8220;early&#8221; and read, &#8220;Be early in prayer to the Lord Almighty.&#8221;<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H413" data-lemma="H413">to</span> the <span class="w H7706" data-lemma="H7706">Almighty</span>,  </span>

Bildad is saying that there is only one way for Job to escape the same fate as his children &#8211; he must implore God&#8217;s mercy. Job&#8217;s speech had spoken about God&#8217;s seeking him and not finding him; but Bildad is speaking of the importance of Job&#8217;s seeking God.<br /></span></span> <span class="w H2134" data-lemma="H2134">pure</span><span class="note"><span class="key">15</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> A verb form needs to be supplied here.

The LXX has &#8220;he will answer your prayer&#8221; (which is probably only the LXX&#8217;s effort to avoid the anthropomorphism [D. J. A. Clines, <i>Job</i> (WBC), 198]). A reading of &#8220;watch over you&#8221; has been adopted because of parallel texts (see H. L. Ginsberg, &#8220;Two North Canaanite Letters from Ugarit,&#8221; <i>BASOR</i> 72 [1938]: 18-19; and H. N. Richardson, &#8220;A Ugaritic Letter of a King to His Mother,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 66 [1947]: 321-24). Others suggest &#8220;his light will shine on you&#8221; or &#8220;he will bestow health on you.&#8221; But the idea of &#8220;awake&#8221; is common enough in the Bible to be retained here.<br /></span></span>   your <span class="w H6664" data-lemma="H6664">righteous</span> <span class="w H5116" data-lemma="H5116">abode</span>.<span class="note"><span class="key">19</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The Piel of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shalam</font>) means &#8220;to make good; to repay; to restore something to its wholeness; to reestablish.&#8221; The best understanding here would be &#8220;restore [Job] to his place.&#8221; Some take the verb in the sense of &#8220;reward [Job himself] with a righteous habitation.&#8221;<br /></span></span>   </span>

But the meaning &#8220;abode of your righteousness&#8221; is clear enough. The righteousness of Job is pictured as inhabiting an estate, or it pictures the place where Job lives as a righteous man. A translation &#8220;rightful habitation&#8221; would mean &#8220;the habitation that you deserve&#8221; &#8211; if you are righteous.<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H1961" data-lemma="H1961">will seem</span> so <span class="w H4705" data-lemma="H4705">small</span>,  since your <span class="w H319" data-lemma="H319">future</span> will <span class="w H3966 H7685" data-lemma="H3966 H7685">flourish</span>.<span class="note"><span class="key">21</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The reference to &#8220;your beginning&#8221; is a reference to Job&#8217;s former estate of wealth and peace.

The verb with the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lamed</font>) preposition after it does mean &#8220;to think on&#8221; or &#8220;to meditate&#8221; (<ref id="18687">Isa 51:13</ref>).

D. M. Derrett pointed out among other things the strong element of reciprocity about weddings in the Ancient Near East. It was possible in certain circumstances to take legal action against the man who failed to provide an appropriate wedding gift. The bridegroom and family here might have been involved in a financial liability for failing to provide adequately for their guests (&#8220;Water into Wine,&#8221; <i>BZ</i> 7 [1963]: 80-97). Was Mary asking for a miracle? There is no evidence that Jesus had worked any miracles prior to this (although this is an argument from silence). Some think Mary was only reporting the situation, or (as Calvin thought) asking Jesus to give some godly exhortations to the guests and thus relieve the bridegroom&#8217;s embarrassment. But the words, and the reply of Jesus in <ref id="26100">v. 4</ref>, seem to imply more. It is not inconceivable that Mary, who had probably been witness to the events of the preceding days, or at least was aware of them, knew that her son&#8217;s public career was beginning. She also knew the supernatural events surrounding his birth, and the prophetic words of the angel, and of Simeon and Anna in the temple at Jesus&#8217; dedication. In short, she had good reason to believe Jesus to be the Messiah, and now his public ministry had begun. In this kind of context, her request does seem more significant.<br /></span></span> </span>
<span class="verse John_2_4" data-osis="John.2.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span> <span class="w G2424" data-lemma="G2424" data-morph="N-NSM">Jesus</span>  <span class="w G3004" data-lemma="G3004" data-morph="V-PAI-3S">replied</span>,<span class="note"><span class="key">6</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;and Jesus said to her.&#8221;<br /></span></span>   <span class="w G1135" data-lemma="G1135" data-morph="N-VSF">“Woman</span>,<span class="note"><span class="key">7</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> The term <i>Woman</i> is Jesus&#8217; normal, polite way of addressing women (<ref id="23662">Matt 15:28</ref>; <ref id="25531">Luke 13:12</ref>; <ref id="26178, 26392, 26852, 26883">John 4:21; 8:10; <ref id="26852">19:26</ref>; 20:15</ref>). But it <i>is</i> unusual for a son to address his mother with this term. The custom in both Hebrew (or Aramaic) and Greek would be for a son to use a qualifying adjective or title. Is there significance in Jesus&#8217; use here? It probably indicates that a new relationship existed between Jesus and his mother once he had embarked on his public ministry. He was no longer or primarily only her son, but the &#8220;Son of Man.&#8221; This is also suggested by the use of the same term in 19:26 in the scene at the cross, where the beloved disciple is &#8220;given&#8221; to Mary as her &#8220;new&#8221; son.<br /></span></span>   <span class="w G5101" data-lemma="G5101" data-morph="I-NSN">why</span> are <span class="w G4671" data-lemma="G4671" data-morph="P-2DS">you</span> saying this <span class="w G1698" data-lemma="G1698" data-morph="P-1DS">to me</span>?<span class="note"><span class="key">8</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;Woman, what to me and to you?&#8221; (an idiom).

The equivalent Hebrew expression in the Old Testament had two basic meanings: (1) When one person was unjustly bothering another, the injured party could say &#8220;What to me and to you?&#8221; meaning, &#8220;What have I done to you that you should do this to me?&#8221; (<ref id="6842">Judg 11:12</ref>; <ref id="11988">2 Chr 35:21</ref>; <ref id="9336">1 Kgs 17:18</ref>). (2) When someone was asked to get involved in a matter he felt was no business of his, he could say to the one asking him, &#8220;What to me and to you?&#8221; meaning, &#8220;That is your business, how am I involved?&#8221; (<ref id="9590">2 Kgs 3:13</ref>; <ref id="22291">Hos 14:8</ref>). Option (1) implies hostility, while option (2) implies merely disengagement. Mere disengagement is almost certainly to be understood here as better fitting the context (although some of the Greek Fathers took the remark as a rebuke to Mary, such a rebuke is unlikely).<br /></span></span>   <span class="w G3450" data-lemma="G3450" data-morph="P-1GS">My</span>  <span class="w G5610" data-lemma="G5610" data-morph="N-NSF">time</span><span class="note"><span class="key">9</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Grk</i> &#8220;my hour&#8221; (referring to the time of Jesus&#8217; crucifixion and return to the Father).<br /><br/></br><b>sn</b> The Greek word translated <i>time</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#8037;&#961;&#945;</font>, <font face="Greektl">Jwra</font>) occurs in <ref id="26100, 26178, 26180, 26236, 26239, 26240, 26359, 26402, 26604, 26608, 26632, 26752">John 2:4; 4:21, 23; 5:25, 28, 29; 7:30; 8:20; 12:23, 27; <ref id="26632">13:1</ref>; 16:25</ref>; and <ref id="26761">17:1</ref>. It is a reference to the special period in Jesus&#8217; life when he was to leave this world and return to the Father (13:1); the hour when the Son of man is glorified (<ref id="26761">17:1</ref>).

The water of Jewish ritual purification has become the wine of the new messianic age. The wine may also be, after the fashion of Johannine double meanings, a reference to the wine of the Lord&#8217;s Supper. A number have suggested this, but there does not seem to be anything in the immediate context which compels this; it seems more related to how frequently a given interpreter sees references to the sacraments in John&#8217;s Gospel as a whole.<br /></span></span>   </span>

The royal official whose son Jesus healed (<ref id="26203-26211">John 4:46-54</ref>) was from Capernaum.

It is entirely possible, however, that the Passovers occurring in the Fourth Gospel are not intended to be understood as listed in chronological sequence. If the material of the Fourth Gospel originally existed in the form of homilies or sermons by the Apostle John on the life and ministry of Jesus, the present arrangement would not have to be in strict chronological order (it does not explicitly claim to be). In this case the Passover mentioned in <ref id="26109">2:13</ref>, for example, might actually be later in Jesus&#8217; public ministry than it might at first glance appear. This leads, however, to a discussion of an even greater problem in the passage, the relationship of the temple cleansing in John&#8217;s Gospel to the similar account in the synoptic gospels.<br /></span></span>   <span class="w G1510" data-lemma="G1510" data-morph="V-IXI-3S">was</span> <span class="w G1451" data-lemma="G1451" data-morph="ADV">near</span>,  <span class="w G2532" data-lemma="G2532" data-morph="CONJ">so</span>  <span class="w G2424" data-lemma="G2424" data-morph="N-NSM">Jesus</span> <span class="w G305" data-lemma="G305" data-morph="V-2AAI-3S">went up</span> <span class="w G1519" data-lemma="G1519" data-morph="PREP">to</span> <span class="w G2414" data-lemma="G2414" data-morph="N-ASF">Jerusalem</span>.<span class="note"><span class="key">28</span><span class="text"><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.<br /></span></span>   </span>

The other accounts of the cleansing of the temple are <ref id="23839-23840">Matt 21:12-13</ref>; <ref id="24656-24658">Mark 11:15-17</ref>; and <ref id="25777-25778">Luke 19:45-46</ref>. None are as long as the Johannine account. The fullest of the synoptic accounts is Mark&#8217;s. John&#8217;s account differs from Mark&#8217;s in the mention of sheep and oxen, the mention of the whip of cords, the Greek word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#949;&#961;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8134;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">kermatisths</font>) for <i>money changer</i> (the synoptics use <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#965;&#946;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8134;&#962;</font> [<font face="Greektl">kollubisths</font>], which John mentions in <ref id="26111">2:15</ref>), the scattering of the <i>coins</i> (<ref id="26111">2:15</ref>), and the command by Jesus, <i>&#8220;Take these things away from here!&#8221;</i> The word for <i>overturned</i> in John is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7936;&#957;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#961;&#949;&#966;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">anastrefw</font>), while Matthew and Mark use <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#961;&#949;&#966;&#969;</font> (<font face="Greektl">katastrefw</font>; Luke does not mention the moneychangers at all). The synoptics all mention that Jesus quoted <ref id="18761">Isa 56:7</ref> followed by <ref id="19131">Jer 7:11</ref>. John mentions no citation of scripture at all, but says that later the disciples remembered <ref id="14945">Ps 69:9</ref>. John does not mention, as does Mark, Jesus&#8217; prohibition on carrying things through the temple (i.e., using it for a shortcut). But the most important difference is one of time: In John the cleansing appears as the first great public act of Jesus&#8217; ministry, while in the synoptics it is virtually the last. The most common solution of the problem, which has been endlessly discussed among NT scholars, is to say there was only one cleansing, and that it took place, as the synoptics record it, at the end of Jesus&#8217; ministry. In the synoptics it appears to be the event that finalized the opposition of the high priest, and precipitated the arrest of Jesus. According to this view, John&#8217;s placing of the event at the opening of Jesus&#8217; ministry is due to his general approach; it was fitting &#8216;theologically&#8217; for Jesus to open his ministry this way, so this is the way John records it. Some have overstated the case for one cleansing and John&#8217;s placing of it at the opening of Jesus&#8217; public ministry, however. For example W. Barclay stated: &#8220;John, as someone has said, is more interested in the truth than in the facts. He was not interested to tell men when Jesus cleansed the Temple; he was supremely interested in telling men that Jesus did cleanse the Temple&#8221; (<i>John</i> [DSBS]<i>,</i> 94). But this is not the impression one gets by a reading of John&#8217;s Gospel: The evangelist seems to go out of his way to give details and facts, including notes of time and place. To argue as Barclay does that John is interested in truth apart from the facts is to set up a false dichotomy. Why should one have to assume, in any case, that there could have been only one cleansing of the temple? This account in John is found in a large section of nonsynoptic material. Apart from the work of John the Baptist &#8211; and even this is markedly different from the references in the synoptics &#8211; nothing else in the first five chapters of John&#8217;s Gospel is found in <i>any</i> of the synoptics. It is certainly not impossible that John took one isolated episode from the conclusion of Jesus&#8217; earthly ministry and inserted it into his own narrative in a place which seemed appropriate according to his purposes. But in view of the differences between John and the synoptics, in both wording and content, as well as setting and time, it is at least possible that the event in question actually occurred twice (unless one begins with the presupposition that the Fourth Gospel is nonhistorical anyway). In support of two separate cleansings of the temple, it has been suggested that Jesus&#8217; actions on this occasion were not permanent in their result, and after (probably) 3 years the <i>status quo</i> in the temple courts had returned to normal. And at this time early in Jesus&#8217; ministry, he was virtually unknown. Such an action as he took on this occasion would have created a stir, and evoked the response John records in <ref id="26114-26118">2:18-22</ref>, but that is probably about all, especially if Jesus&#8217; actions met with approval among part of the populace. But later in Jesus&#8217; ministry, when he was well-known, and vigorously opposed by the high-priestly party in Jerusalem, his actions might have brought forth another, harsher response. It thus appears possible to argue for two separate cleansings of the temple as well as a single one relocated by John to suit his own purposes. Which then is more probable? On the whole, more has been made of the differences between John&#8217;s account and the synoptic accounts than perhaps should have been. After all, the synoptic accounts also differ considerably from one another, yet few scholars would be willing to posit four cleansings of the temple as an explanation for this. While it is certainly possible that the author did not intend by his positioning of the temple cleansing to correct the synoptics&#8217; timing of the event, but to highlight its significance for the course of Jesus&#8217; ministry, it still appears somewhat more probable that John has placed the event he records in the approximate period of Jesus&#8217; public ministry in which it did occur, that is, within the first year or so of Jesus&#8217; public ministry.

That does not, however, mean that their concept of &#8220;Messiah&#8221; was the same as Jesus&#8217; own, or the author&#8217;s.<br /></span></span>   </span>

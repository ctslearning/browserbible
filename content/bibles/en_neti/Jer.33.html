I formed it in such a way as to firmly establish it&#8221;; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Thus says the <sc>Lord</sc> who makes/does it, the <sc>Lord</sc> who forms it to establish it, whose name is the <sc>Lord</sc>.&#8221; It is unclear what the antecedent of &#8220;it&#8221; is. The Greek version supplies the object &#8220;the earth.&#8221; However, as D. Barth&#233;lemy, ed., <i>Preliminary and Interim Report on the Hebrew Old Testament Text Project</i>, <ref id="99999">4:269</ref>, notes, this is probably a smoothing of a text which had no object other than the pronoun. No other text or version has an object other than the pronoun. It could be argued that &#8220;the earth&#8221; is to be understood as the intended referent from other contexts within the book of Jeremiah (<ref id="19214, 19218, 20228">Jer 10:12, 16; 51:15</ref>) where these verbs refer to the <sc>Lord</sc> as creator and from the prior context in <ref id="19749">32:17</ref> where the <sc>Lord</sc>&#8217;s power as creator is the basis for the assertion that nothing is too hard for him. This is the object that is supplied in a number of modern English versions and commentaries. However, the use of the feminine singular pronoun in other contexts to refer to an indefinite reality which is spelled out in the preceding or following context (cf. <ref id="10087">2 Kgs 19:25</ref>; <ref id="18064, 18379, 18541">Isa 22:11; 37:26; 44:7</ref>) lends credence to the suggestion by the committee for <i>The Hebrew Old Testament Project</i> that the pronoun refers to the work or plan of the <sc>Lord</sc>, a view which is reflected in the NJPS and has been adopted here. For the use of the verb &#8220;form&#8221; here in the sense of &#8220;plan&#8221; see BDB 427 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1510;&#1463;&#1512;</font> 2.b and compare the usage in <ref id="18064, 18379">Isa 22:11; 37:26</ref>. The best discussion of options is given in G. L. Keown, P. J. Scalise, T. G. Smothers, <i>Jeremiah 26-52</i> (WBC), 169-70, who see the pronoun referring ahead to the great and hidden things of <ref id="19779">v. 3</ref>. As in several other cases our translation has opted for a first person introduction rather than the third person of the original because the <sc>Lord</sc> himself is speaking.<br /></span></span>  I am <span class="w H8034" data-lemma="H8034">known</span> as the <span class="w H3068" data-lemma="H3068">Lord</span>.

G. L. Keown, P. J. Scalise, and T. G. Smothers (<i>Jeremiah 26-52</i> [WBC], 170) make the interesting observation that the word is used here in a context in which the fortifications of Jerusalem are about to fall to the Babylonians; the fortified things in God&#8217;s secret counsel fall through answer to prayer.<br /></span></span>   things which you still do <span class="w H3808" data-lemma="H3808">not</span> <span class="w H3045" data-lemma="H3045">know</span> about.’ </span>

The translation and precise meaning of <ref id="19780-19781">vv. 4-5</ref> are uncertain at a number of points due to some difficult syntactical constructions and some debate about the text and meaning of several words. The text reads more literally, &#8220;<b>33:4</b> For thus says the <sc>Lord</sc>, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah which have been torn down on account the siege ramps and the sword <b>33:5</b> going to fight the Chaldeans and to fill them with the dead bodies of the men whom I have killed in my anger and in my wrath and on account of all whose wickedness I have hidden my face from this city.&#8221; There are two difficult syntactical forms (1) the participle at the beginning of <ref id="19781">v. 5</ref> &#8220;going [or those going] to fight&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ba</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>) and (2) the infinitive plus suffix that introduces the next clause &#8220;and to fill them&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ul&#255;mal</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">am</font>). The translation has interpreted the former as a verbal use of the participle with an indefinite subject &#8220;they&#8221; (= the defenders of Jerusalem who have torn down the buildings; cf. GKC 460-61 &#167;144.<i>i</i> for this point of grammar). The conjunction plus preposition plus infinitive construct has been interpreted as equivalent to a finite verb (cf. <i>IBHS</i> 611 &#167;36.3.2a, i.e., &#8220;and they will fill them [the houses and buildings of v. 4]&#8221;). Adopting the Greek text of these two verses would produce a smoother reading. It reads &#8220;For thus says the <sc>Lord</sc> concerning the houses of this city and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah which have been pulled down for mounds and fortifications to fight against the Chaldeans and to fill it [should be &#8220;them&#8221;] with the corpses of men whom I smote in my anger and my wrath and I turned away my face from them [rather than from &#8220;this city&#8221; of the Hebrew text] for all their wickedness: Behold I will&#8230;&#8221; The Greek does not have the problem with the participle because it has seen it as part of a word meaning fortification. This also eliminates the problem with the infinitive because it is interpreted as parallel with &#8220;to fight.&#8221; I.e., the defenders used these torn-down buildings for defensive fortifications and for burial places. It would be tempting to follow this reading. However, there is no graphically close form for &#8220;fortification&#8221; that would explain how the more difficult <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1462;&#1495;&#1464;&#1512;&#1462;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hekharev ba</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>) of the Hebrew text arose and there is doubt whether <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1465;&#1500;&#1456;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sol&#255;lot</font>) can refer to a defense mound. W. L. Holladay (<i>Jeremiah</i> [Hermeneia], <ref id="99999, 99999">2:221, 225</ref>) has suggested reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1512;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hakharakim</font>) in place of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1462;&#1495;&#1464;&#1512;&#1462;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hekharev</font>) in the technical sense of &#8220;crenels,&#8221; the gaps between the raised portion on top of the wall (which raised portion he calls &#8220;merlons&#8221; and equates with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1465;&#1500;&#1456;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font>, <font face="Scholar">sol&#255;lot</font>). He does not, however, further suggest seeing <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ba</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>) as part of this corrupted form, choosing to see it rather as a gloss. His emendation and interpretation, however, have been justly criticized as violating the usage of both <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1465;&#1500;&#1456;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</font> which is elsewhere &#8220;siege mound&#8221; and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1458;&#1512;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kharakim</font>) which elsewhere refers only to the latticed opening of a window (<ref id="17564">Song 2:9</ref>). Until a more acceptable explanation of how the difficult Hebrew text could have arisen from the Greek, the Hebrew should be retained, though it is admittedly awkward. G. L. Keown, P. J. Scalise, and T. G. Smothers (<i>Jeremiah 26-52</i> [WBC], 166, 172) have perhaps the best discussion of the issues and the options involved here.<br /></span></span> </span> </span>

The sentence has been broken down in conformity with contemporary English style.<br /><br/></br><b>sn</b> Context makes it clear that what is in view is an innumerable line of descendants from the righteous ruler that the <sc>Lord</sc> raises up over Israel and Judah after their regathering and restoration to the land. What is in view, then, is a reinstitution or reinstatement of the Davidic covenant of grant, the perpetual right of the Davidic dynasty to rule over the nation of Israel for all time (see also <ref id="19802">v. 26</ref>). This is guaranteed by the creation order which is the object of both God&#8217;s creative decree (<ref id="14-19">Gen 1:14-19</ref>) and his covenant with Noah after the flood (<ref id="206">Gen 8:22</ref>). (For further discussion on the nature of a covenant of grant see the study note on <ref id="19772">32:40</ref>.) The rejection of the lines of Jehoiakim (<ref id="19873">36:30</ref>) and Jeconiah (<ref id="19485">22:30</ref>) and the certain captivity and death of Zedekiah (<ref id="19736">32:4</ref>) may have called into question the continuance of the Davidic promise which always had a certain conditional nature to it (cf. <ref id="8775, 9011, 9057">1 Kgs 2:4; 8:25; 9:5</ref>). This promise and this guarantee show that the covenant of grant still stands and will ultimately find its fulfillment. Because this promise never found its fulfillment after the return from exile, it is left to the NT to show how it is fulfilled (cf., e.g., <ref id="23146-23162">Matt 1:1-17</ref> where it is emphasized that Jesus is the son (and heir) of both Abraham and David).<br /></span></span>    </span>

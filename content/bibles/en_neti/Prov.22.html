Some English versions render the phrase &#8220;favor is better than silver or gold&#8221; (so NASB, NRSV) making it parallel to the first colon. But if &#8220;good&#8221; is retained as an attributive modifier, then it would mean one was well thought of, or one had engaging qualities (cf. ASV &#8220;loving favor; NLT &#8220;high esteem&#8221;). This fits with the idea of the reputation in the first colon, for a good name would bring with it the favor of others.<br /></span></span>   more than <span class="w H3701" data-lemma="H3701">silver</span> or <span class="w H2091" data-lemma="H2091">gold</span>.  </span>

KJV, ASV). The point is that rich and poor live side by side in this life, but they are both part of God&#8217;s creation (cf. NAB, NASB &#8220;have a common bond&#8221;). Some commentators have taken this to mean that they should live together <i>because</i> they are part of God&#8217;s creation; but the verb form will not sustain that meaning.<br /></span></span>  the <span class="w H3068" data-lemma="H3068">Lord</span> is the <span class="w H6213" data-lemma="H6213">creator</span> of them both.<span class="note"><span class="key">5</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;all.&#8221; The <sc>Lord</sc> is sovereign over both groups, that is, he has had the final say whether a person is rich or poor.

The word &#8220;thorns&#8221; may be obscure, but it is supported by the LXX (&#8220;prickly plants&#8221;) and an apparent cognate &#8220;thorns&#8221; in <ref id="4816">Num 33:55</ref> and <ref id="6474">Josh 23:13</ref>. But some (including the editors of <i>BHS</i>) suggest changing it to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsammim</font>, &#8220;traps&#8221; changing a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;</font> [<i>nun</i>] to a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;</font> [<i>mem</i>]). But BDB 855 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> acknowledges that this word is a doubtful word, attested only a couple of times in Job (e.g., <ref id="16911">18:9</ref>). W. McKane traces a development from the idea of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1461;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsen</font>, &#8220;basket; trap&#8221;) to support this change (<i>Proverbs</i> [OTL], 565). The present translation (like many other English versions) has retained &#8220;thorns,&#8221; even though the parallelism with &#8220;traps&#8221; is not very good; as the harder reading it is preferred. The variant readings have little textual or philological support, and simplify the line.<br /><br/></br><b>sn</b> &#8220;Thorns and snares&#8221; represent the dangers and threats to life.

<span class="verse Prov_22_6" data-osis="Prov.22.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="w H2596" data-lemma="H2596">Train</span><span class="note"><span class="key">14</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1504;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khanakh</font>) means &#8220;to train up; to dedicate&#8221; (BDB 335 s.v.; <i>HALOT</i> 334 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1504;&#1498;</font>). The verb is used elsewhere to refer to dedicating a house (<ref id="5433">Deut 20:5</ref>; <ref id="9049">1 Kgs 8:63</ref>; <ref id="11330">2 Chr 7:5</ref>). The related noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1458;&#1504;&#1467;&#1499;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khanukhah</font>) means &#8220;dedication; consecration&#8221; (BDB 335 s.v.; <i>HALOT</i> 334 s.v.), and is used in reference to the dedication or consecration of altars (<ref id="3861">Num 7:10</ref>; <ref id="11334">2 Chr 7:9</ref>), the temple (<ref id="14321">Ps 30:1</ref>), and town walls (<ref id="12652">Neh 12:27</ref>). The related adjective <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khanikh</font>) describes &#8220;trained, tried, experienced&#8221; men (BDB 335 s.v.; <ref id="351">Gen 14:14</ref>). In the related cognate languages the verb has similar meanings: Aramaic &#8220;to train,&#8221; Ethiopic &#8220;to initiate,&#8221; and Arabic IV &#8220;to learn; to make experienced&#8221; (<i>HALOT</i> 334 s.v.). This proverb pictures a child who is dedicated by parents to the <sc>Lord</sc> and morally trained to follow him. On the other hand, a popular expositional approach suggests that it means &#8220;to motivate.&#8221; This view is based on a cognate Arabic root II which (among many other things) refers to the practice of rubbing the palate of a newborn child with date juice or olive oil to motivate the child to suck. While this makes an interesting sermon illustration, it is highly unlikely that this concept was behind this Hebrew verb. The Arabic meaning is late and secondary &#8211; the Arabic term did not have this meaning until nearly a millennium after this proverb was written.<br /></span></span>   a <span class="w H5288" data-lemma="H5288">child</span><span class="note"><span class="key">15</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">na</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ar</font>) is traditionally translated &#8220;child&#8221; here (so almost all English versions), but might mean &#8220;youth.&#8221; The noun can refer to a broad range of ages (see BDB 654-55 s.v.; <i>HALOT</i> 707 s.v.): infant (<ref id="1561">Exod 2:6</ref>), weaned child (<ref id="7237">1 Sam 1:24</ref>), young child (<ref id="18953">Jer 1:6</ref>), lad (<ref id="560">Gen 22:12</ref>), adolescent (<ref id="1086">Gen 37:2</ref>), or young man of marriageable age (<ref id="1000">Gen 34:19</ref>). The context focuses on the child&#8217;s young, formative years. The Talmud says this would be up to the age of twenty-four.<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H5921" data-lemma="H5921">in</span> the <span class="w H1870" data-lemma="H1870">way</span>  <span class="w H3588" data-lemma="H3588">that</span> he should go,<span class="note"><span class="key">16</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The expression in Hebrew is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497; &#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al-pi darko</font>), which can be rendered &#8220;according to his way&#8221;; NEB &#8220;Start a boy on the right road.&#8221; The expression &#8220;his way&#8221; is &#8220;the way he should go&#8221;; it reflects the point the book of Proverbs is making that there is a standard of life to which he must attain. Saadia, a Jewish scholar who lived <sc>a.d.</sc> 882-942, first suggested that this could mean the child should be trained according to his inclination or bent of mind. This may have some merit in practice, but it is not likely what the proverb had in mind. In the book of Proverbs there are only two ways that a person can go, the way of the wise or righteousness, and the way of the fool. One takes training, and the other does not. Ralbag, in fact, offered a satirical interpretation: &#8220;Train a child according to his evil inclinations (let him have his will) and he will continue in his evil way throughout life&#8221; (J. H. Greenstone, <i>Proverbs</i>, 234). C. H. Toy says the expression means &#8220;in accordance with the manner of life to which he is destined (<i>Proverbs</i> [ICC], 415). W. McKane says, &#8220;There is only one right way &#8211; the way of life &#8211; and the educational discipline which directs young men along this way is uniform&#8221; (<i>Proverbs</i> [OTL], 564). This phrase does not describe the concept perpetuated by a modern psychological interpretation of the verse: Train a child according to his personality trait.<br /></span></span>  and when he is <span class="w H2204" data-lemma="H2204">old</span> he will <span class="w H3808" data-lemma="H3808">not</span> <span class="w H5493" data-lemma="H5493">turn</span> <span class="w H4480" data-lemma="H4480">from</span> it.<span class="note"><span class="key">17</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> The expected consequence of such training is that it will last throughout life. The sages were confident of the character-forming quality of their training. However, proverbs are not universal truths. One can anticipate positive results from careful child-training &#8211; but there may be an occasional exception.<br /></span></span> </span>

But the Hebrew text is not obscure, and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1489;&#1462;&#1512;</font> does not exactly mean &#8220;produce.&#8221; The expression &#8220;rod of his wrath&#8221; may not follow the imagery of 8a very closely, but it is nonetheless understandable. The &#8220;rod&#8221; is a symbol of power; &#8220;wrath&#8221; is a metonymy of cause indicating what wrath will do, and an objective genitive. The expression signifies that in reaping trouble for his sins this person will no longer be able to unleash his fury on others. The LXX adds: &#8220;A man who is cheerful and a giver God blesses&#8221; (e.g., <ref id="28964">2 Cor 9:7</ref>).<br /></span></span>   will <span class="w H3615" data-lemma="H3615">end</span>.  </span>

In postbiblical Hebrew it refers to &#8220;rundles&#8221; (Jastrow 476 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;</font>). The term here has been translated in various ways: &#8220;[thigh] joints&#8221; (KJV), &#8220;rounded [thighs]&#8221; (RSV), &#8220;curves [of thighs]&#8221; (NASB), &#8220;graceful [thighs]&#8221; (NIV).<br /></span></span>   of your <span class="w H3409" data-lemma="H3409">thighs</span><span class="note"><span class="key">4</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1512;&#1461;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yarekh</font>, &#8220;thigh&#8221;) may refer to (1) the fleshy upper part of the thigh where the leg joins the pelvis (<ref id="954-961, 1413">Gen 32:25-32; 46:26</ref>; <ref id="1538">Exod 1:5</ref>; <ref id="6750">Judg 8:30</ref>) or (2) the outside of the thigh from the hip down (<ref id="2466">Exod 32:27</ref>; <ref id="6585, 6590">Judg 3:16, 21</ref>; <ref id="14602">Ps 45:4</ref>; <ref id="17580">Song 3:8</ref>). The first usage is usually restricted to a figure for the male loins, the source of male procreation (<ref id="1413">Gen 46:26</ref>; <ref id="1538">Exod 1:5</ref>) and the locus of an oath (<ref id="594, 601, 1450">Gen 24:2, 9; 47:29</ref>).<br /></span></span>   are <span class="w H3644" data-lemma="H3644">like</span> <span class="w H2481" data-lemma="H2481">jewels</span>,  the <span class="w H4639" data-lemma="H4639">work</span> of the <span class="w H3027" data-lemma="H3027">hands</span> of a <span class="w H542" data-lemma="H542">master craftsman</span>.  </span>
<span class="verse Song_7_2" data-osis="Song.7.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Your <span class="w H8326" data-lemma="H8326">navel</span><span class="note"><span class="key">5</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1512;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shorer</font>) is a <i>hapax legomenon</i>, appearing in the OT only here. There is debate whether it means &#8220;navel&#8221; or &#8220;vulva&#8221;: (1) Lys and Pope suggest that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1512;&#1462;&#1512;</font> is related to Arabic <i>srr</i> (&#8220;secret place, pudenda, coition, fornication&#8221;). They suggest that this is contextually supported by three factors: (a) His descriptive praise of her is in ascending order, beginning with her feet and concluding with her hair. The movement from her thighs (<ref id="17629">7:1</ref>b), to her vulva (<ref id="17630">7:2</ref>a), and then to her waist (<ref id="17630">7:2</ref>b) would fit this. (b) The descriptive comparison to a glass of wine would be grotesque if her navel were in view &#8211; her navel was moist or filled with liquid? &#8211; but appropriate if her vulva were in view. (c) The navel would be a somewhat synonymous reference to the belly which is already denoted by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1496;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bitnekh</font>, &#8220;belly&#8221;) in the following line. Because <ref id="17629-17635">7:1-7</ref> does not use synonymous parallelism, the term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1512;&#1462;&#1512;</font> would have to refer to something other than the belly. (2) The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1512;&#1462;&#1512;</font> denotes &#8220;navel&#8221;: (a) It may be related to the bi-consonantal noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shor</font>, &#8220;navel, umbilical cord&#8221;) (<ref id="16464">Prov 3:8</ref>; <ref id="20767">Ezek 16:4</ref>). (b) Mishnaic Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sharar</font>) denotes &#8220;navel, umbilical cord&#8221; (Jastrow 1634 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1512;</font>). For example, in a midrash on the Book of Numbers, the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1512;&#1462;&#1512;</font> appears in an allusion to <ref id="17631">Song 7:3</ref> to justify the seating of the Sanhedrin in the middle of the synagogue: &#8220;As the navel (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1512;&#1462;&#1512;</font>) is placed in the centre of the body, so are the Sanhedrin&#8230;&#8221; (<i>Num. Rab.</i> <ref id="17542">1:4</ref>). On the other hand, the meaning &#8220;vulva&#8221; never appears in Mishnaic Hebrew. Therefore, apart from this disputed usage there is no evidence that this term was ever used in this manner in Hebrew. (c) Rather than <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1512;&#1462;&#1512;</font> being related to Arabic <i>sirr</i> (&#8220;pudenda&#8221;), it could just as easily be related to the Arabic noun <i>surr</i> &#8220;navel.&#8221; It is methodologically more sound to define <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1512;&#1462;&#1512;</font> as &#8220;navel&#8221; than as &#8220;vulva.&#8221; (d) The nuance &#8220;navel&#8221; is not as out of line contextually as Lys and Pope suggest. The navel would not be out of place in the ascending order of praise because the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1496;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (&#8220;abdomen&#8221;) which follows may be viewed as both above and below the navel. The figurative association of the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1512;&#1462;&#1512;</font> as a mixing bowl filled with wine does not imply that this bodily part must actually be moist or filled with liquid as Pope suggests. The point of comparison is not physical or visual but one of function, i.e., it is intoxicating. The comparison of the navel to a mixing bowl of wine is no more out of line than the comparison of the belly to a heap of wheat in the next line. In fact, the two go together &#8211; she is both the &#8220;drink&#8221; and &#8220;food&#8221; for Solomon. The shape of the navel is as congruent with the metaphor of the &#8220;round bowl&#8221; as the vulva; both are round and receding. (3) Since both terms are derived from the same geminate root &#8211; Hebrew <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1512;&#1462;&#1512;</font> and Arabic <i>srr</i> &#8211; it is more prudent to take the term as a synecdoche of whole (lower region) for the parts (including navel and vulva). The attempt to decide between these two options may be illegitimately splitting hairs. See K&amp;D <ref id="99999">18:123</ref>; J. S. Deere, &#8220;<i>Song of Solomon</i>,&#8221; <i>BKCOT</i>, 199-200; D. Lys, &#8220;Notes sur de Cantique,&#8221; VTSup 17 (1969): 171-78; M. H. Pope, <i>Song of Songs</i> (AB), 617; G. L.

Archaeologists have recovered examples of such large, deep, two handled, ring-based round bowls. The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1503;</font> (&#8220;mixing bowl&#8221;) came into Greek usage as <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7938;&#947;&#947;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">angos</font>) which designates vessels used for mixing wine (e.g., Homer, <i>Odyssey</i> xvi 16) (LSJ 7). This is consistent with the figurative references to wine which follows: &#8220;may it never lack mixed wine.&#8221; Selected Bibliography: J. P. Brown, &#8220;The Mediterranean Vocabulary for Wine,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 19 (1969): 158; A. M. Honeyman, &#8220;The Pottery Vessels of the Old Testament,&#8221; <i>PEQ</i> 80 (1939): 79. The comparison of her navel to a &#8220;round mixing bowl&#8221; is visually appropriate in that both are round and receding. The primary point of comparison to the round bowl is one of sense, as the following clause makes clear: &#8220;may it never lack mixed wine.&#8221; J. S. Deere suggests that the point of comparison is that of taste, desirability, and function (&#8220;<i>Song of Solomon</i>,&#8221; <i>BKCOT</i>, 202). More specifically, it probably refers to the source of intoxication, that is, just as a bowl used to mix wine was the source of physical intoxication, so she was the source of his sexual intoxication. She intoxicated Solomon with her love in the same way that wine intoxicates a person.<br /></span></span>   may it <span class="w H408" data-lemma="H408">never</span> <span class="w H2637" data-lemma="H2637">lack</span><span class="note"><span class="key">7</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1462;&#1495;&#1456;&#1505;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al-yekhsar</font>) has traditionally been taken as an imperfect: &#8220;it never lacks mixed wine&#8221; (M. H. Pope, <i>Song of Songs</i> [AB], 619); &#8220;which wanteth not liquor&#8221; (KJV); &#8220;in which liquor is never lacking&#8221; (RSV); &#8220;that never lacks mixed wine&#8221; (JB); &#8220;with no lack of wine&#8221; (NEB); &#8220;that shall never want for spiced wine&#8221; (NEB); &#8220;that never lacks blended wine&#8221; (NIV). This is also how LXX understood it: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#956;&#8052; &#8017;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#973;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962; &#954;&#961;&#8118;&#956;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">mh usteroumenos,</font> &#8220;not lacking liquor&#8221;). However, the negative <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>) normally precedes a jussive expressing a wish or request: &#8220;May it never lack mixed wine!&#8221; (J. S. Deere, &#8220;<i>Song of Solomon</i>,&#8221; <i>BKCOT</i>, 202). This approach is adopted by several translations: &#8220;that should never lack for mixed wine&#8221; (NASB) and &#8220;Let mixed wine not be lacking!&#8221; (NJPS).<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H4197" data-lemma="H4197">mixed wine!</span><span class="note"><span class="key">8</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1494;&#1462;&#1490;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mazeg</font>, &#8220;mixed wine&#8221;) does not refer to wine mixed with water to dilute its potency, but to strong wine mixed with weaker wine. The practice of mixing wine with water is not attested in the Hebrew Bible. Both <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1494;&#1462;&#1490;</font> and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1462;&#1505;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mesekh</font>) refer to strong wine mixed with weaker wine. The rabbis later distinguished between the two, stating that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1494;&#1462;&#1490;</font> was strong wine mixed with weak wine, while <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1462;&#1505;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</font> was wine mixed with water (Aboda Zara 58b). However, both types of wine were intoxicating. Mixed wine was the most intoxicating type of wine. In a midrash on the Book of Numbers a comment is made about the practice of mixing strong wine with weaker wine (e.g., <ref id="17762">Isa 5:22</ref>; <ref id="17075">Prov 23:30</ref>), stating its purpose: &#8220;They used to mix strong wine with weak wine so as to get drunk with it&#8221; (<i>Num. Rab.</i> <ref id="99999">10:8</ref>). See J. P. Brown, &#8220;The Mediterranean Vocabulary of Wine,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 19 (1969): 154. The comparison of a wife&#8217;s sexual love to intoxicating wine is common in ancient Near Eastern love literature. Parallel in thought are the words of the Hebrew sage, &#8220;May your fountain be blessed and may you rejoice in the wife of your youth. A loving doe, a graceful deer &#8211; may her love (or breasts) always intoxicate you, may you ever stagger like a drunkard in her love&#8221; (<ref id="16536-16537">Prov 5:18-19</ref>).<br /></span></span>   Your <span class="w H990" data-lemma="H990">belly</span><span class="note"><span class="key">9</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> Alternately, &#8220;your waist.&#8221; The term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1496;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bitnekh</font>) probably refers to the woman&#8217;s &#8220;belly&#8221; rather than &#8220;waist.&#8221; It is associated with a woman&#8217;s abdominal/stomach region rather than her hips (<ref id="16773, 16922">Prov 13:25; 18:20</ref>; <ref id="20506">Ezek 3:3</ref>). The comparison of her belly to a heap of wheat is visually appropriate because of the similarity of their symmetrical shape and tannish color. The primary point of comparison, however, is based upon the commonplace association of wheat in Israel, namely, wheat was the main staple of the typical Israelite meal (<ref id="5773">Deut 32:14</ref>; <ref id="8127, 8478">2 Sam 4:6; 17:28</ref>; <ref id="99999">1 Kgs 5:25</ref>; <ref id="15232, 16366">Pss 81:14; 147:14</ref>). Just as wheat satisfied an Israelite&#8217;s physical hunger, she satisfied his sexual hunger. J. S. Deere makes this point in the following manner: &#8220;The most obvious commonplace of wheat was its function, that is, it served as one of the main food sources in ancient Palestine. The Beloved was both the &#8216;food&#8217; (wheat) and &#8216;drink&#8217; (wine) of the Lover. Her physical expression of love nourished and satisfied him. His satisfaction was great for the &#8216;mixed wine&#8217; is intoxicating and the &#8216;heap of wheat&#8217; was capable of feeding many. The &#8216;heap of wheat&#8217; also suggests the harvest, an association which contributes to the emotional quality of the metaphor. The harvest was accompanied with a joyous celebration over the bounty yielded up by the land. So also, the Beloved is bountiful and submissive in giving of herself, and the source of great joy&#8221; (&#8220;<i>Song of Solomon</i>,&#8221; <i>BKCOT</i>, 203-204).<br /></span></span>   is a <span class="w H6194" data-lemma="H6194">mound</span> of <span class="w H2406" data-lemma="H2406">wheat</span>,  <span class="w H5473" data-lemma="H5473">encircled</span><span class="note"><span class="key">10</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;fenced around by.&#8221;<br /></span></span>   by <span class="w H7799" data-lemma="H7799">lilies</span>.  </span>

Solomon had previously compared her neck to a tower (<ref id="17587">Song 4:4</ref>). In both cases the most obvious point of comparison has to do with size and shape, that is, her neck was long and symmetrical. Archaeology has never found a tower overlaid with ivory in the ancient Near East and it is doubtful that there ever was such a tower. The point of comparison might simply be that the shape of her neck looks like a tower, while the color and smoothness of her neck was like ivory. Solomon is mixing metaphors: her neck was long and symmetrical like a tower; but also elegant, smooth, and beautiful as ivory. The beauty, elegance, and smoothness of a woman&#8217;s neck is commonly compared to ivory in ancient love literature. For example, in a piece of Greek love literature, Anacron compared the beauty of the neck of his beloved Bathyllus to ivory (Ode xxxix 28-29).<br /></span></span>   Your <span class="w H5869" data-lemma="H5869">eyes</span> are the <span class="w H1295" data-lemma="H1295">pools</span> <span class="w H5921" data-lemma="H5921">in</span> <span class="w H2809" data-lemma="H2809">Heshbon</span> by the <span class="w H8179" data-lemma="H8179">gate</span> of <span class="w H1337" data-lemma="H1337">Bath-Rabbim</span>.<span class="note"><span class="key">12</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> It is impossible at the present time to determine the exact significance of the comparison of her eyes to the &#8220;gate of Bath-Rabbim&#8221; because this site has not yet been identified by archaeologists.<br /></span></span>   Your <span class="w H639" data-lemma="H639">nose</span> is like the <span class="w H4026" data-lemma="H4026">tower</span> of <span class="w H3844" data-lemma="H3844">Lebanon</span> <span class="w H6822" data-lemma="H6822">overlooking</span>  <span class="w H1834" data-lemma="H1834">Damascus</span>.  </span>

NASB translates it as &#8220;purple threads,&#8221; while NIV nuances this term as &#8220;royal tapestry.&#8221; M. H. Pope (<i>The Song of Songs</i> [AB], 629-30) adduces several ancient Near Eastern texts and suggests that it refers to purple hair-dye. The comparison is to hair which entangles Solomon like binding cords and therefore, it seems most likely that the idea here must be purple threads. The Hebrew noun is a loanword from Hittite <i>argaman</i> &#8220;tribute,&#8221; which is reflected in Akkadian <i>argamannu</i> &#8220;purple&#8221; (also &#8220;tribute&#8221; under Hittite influence), Ugaritic <i>argmn</i> &#8220;tax, purple,&#8221; Aramaic <i>argwn</i> &#8220;purple&#8221; (<i>HALOT</i> 84). Purple cloth and threads were considered very valuable (<ref id="21129, 21138">Ezek 27:7, 16</ref>) and were commonly worn by kings as a mark of their royal position (<ref id="6746">Judg 8:26</ref>).<br /></span></span>   the <span class="w H4428" data-lemma="H4428">king</span> is held <span class="w H631" data-lemma="H631">captive</span><span class="note"><span class="key">17</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> Alternately, &#8220;captivated.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1505;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">asar</font>, &#8220;to bind, capture, hold captive, put in prison&#8221;) is commonly used of binding a prisoner with cords and fetters (<ref id="1287">Gen 42:34</ref>; <ref id="6940-6943, 6955-6962">Judg 15:10-13; 16:5-12</ref>; <ref id="9988, 10199, 10230">2 Kgs 17:4; 23:33; 25:7</ref>; <ref id="11920">2 Chr 33:11</ref>) (<i>HALOT</i> 75 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1505;&#1512;</font>). It is frequently used as a figure to depict absolute authority over a person (<ref id="15629">Ps 105:22</ref>). The passive participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font> means &#8220;to be bound, held captive, imprisoned&#8221; (<ref id="8116">2 Sam 3:34</ref>; <ref id="19943">Jer 40:1</ref>; <ref id="13745">Job 36:8</ref>). Like a prisoner bound in cords and fetters and held under the complete control and authority of his captor, Solomon was captivated by the spellbinding power of her hair. In a word, he was the prisoner of love and she was his captor. Similar imagery appears in an ancient Egyptian love song: &#8220;With her hair she throws lassoes at me, with her eyes she catches me, with her necklace she entangles me, and with her seal ring she brands me&#8221; (Song 43 in the Chester Beatty Cycle, translated by W. K. Simpson, ed., <i>The Literature of Ancient Egypt</i>, 324). J. S. Deere suggests, &#8220;The concluding part of the metaphor, &#8216;The king is held captive by your tresses,&#8217; is a beautiful expression of the powerful effect of love. A strong monarch was held prisoner by the beauty of his Beloved&#8221; (&#8220;<i>Song of Solomon</i>,&#8221; <i>BKCOT</i>, 206-207). This is a startling statement because Solomon emphasizes that the one who was being held captive like a prisoner in bonds was the &#8220;king&#8221;! At this point in world history, Solomon was the ruler of the most powerful and wealthy nation in the world (<ref id="8830, 9103-9109">1 Kgs 3:13; 10:23-29</ref>).

It flourished in warm moist areas and oases from Egypt to India. Ancient Iraq was the leading grower of date palms and dates in the ancient world, as today (M. H. Pope, <i>The Song of Songs</i> [AB], 633). There is also a hint of eroticism in this palm tree metaphor because the palm tree was often associated with fertility in the ancient world. The point of comparison is that she is a tall, slender, fertile young woman. The comparison of a tall and slender lady to a palm tree is not uncommon in love literature: &#8220;O you, whose height is that of a palm tree in a serail&#8221; (Homer, <i>Odyssey</i> vi 162-63) (S.

The comparison between her breasts and clusters of dates probably has to do with shape and multiplicity, as well as taste, as the rest of this extended metaphor intimates. M. H. Pope (<i>The Song of Songs</i> [AB], 634) notes: &#8220;The comparison of the breasts to date clusters presumably intended a pair of clusters to match the dual form of the word for &#8216;breasts.&#8217; A single cluster of dates may carry over a thousand single fruits and weigh twenty pounds or more. It may be noted that the multiple breasts of the representations of Artemis of Ephesus look very much like a cluster of large dates, and it might be that the date clusters here were intended to suggest a similar condition of polymasty.&#8221;<br /></span></span>   </span>

Because of their height and because the dates would not naturally fall off the tree, the only way to harvest dates from a palm tree is to climb the tree and pluck the fruit off the stalks. This seems to be the primary imagery behind this figurative expression. The point of comparison here would be that just as one would climb a palm tree to pluck its fruit so that it might be eaten and enjoyed, so too Solomon wanted to embrace his Beloved so that he might embrace and enjoy her breasts. It is possible that the process of pollination is also behind this figure. A palm tree is climbed to pick its fruit or to dust the female flowers with pollen from the male flowers (the female and male flowers were on separate trees). To obtain a better yield and accelerate the process of pollination, the date grower would transfer pollen from the male trees to the flowers on the female trees. This method of artificial pollination is depicted in ancient Near Eastern art. For example, a relief from Gozan (Tel Halaf) dating to the 9th century <sc>b.c.</sc> depicts a man climbing a palm tree on a wooden ladder with his hands stretched out to take hold of its top branches to pollinate the flowers or to pick the fruit from the tree. The point of this playful comparison is clear: Just as a palm tree grower would climb a female tree to pick its fruit and to pollinate it with a male flower, Solomon wanted to grasp her breasts and to make love to her (<i>The Illustrated Family Encyclopedia of the Living Bible</i>, <ref id="99999">10:60</ref>).<br /></span></span>   and <span class="w H270" data-lemma="H270">take hold</span> of its <span class="w H5577" data-lemma="H5577">fruit stalks</span>.  <span class="w H4994" data-lemma="H4994">May</span> your <span class="w H7699" data-lemma="H7699">breasts</span> <span class="w H1961" data-lemma="H1961">be</span> like the <span class="w H811" data-lemma="H811">clusters</span> of <span class="w H1612" data-lemma="H1612">grapes</span>,<span class="note"><span class="key">25</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;of the vine.&#8221;<br /></span></span>   and may the <span class="w H7381" data-lemma="H7381">fragrance</span> of your <span class="w H639" data-lemma="H639">breath</span> be like <span class="w H8598" data-lemma="H8598">apricots!</span><span class="note"><span class="key">26</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The Hebrew noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tappukha</font>) has been traditionally been translated as &#8220;apple,&#8221; but modern botanists and the most recent lexicographers now identify <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font> with the &#8220;apricot&#8221; (BDB 656 s.v.

The unusual shape of the large forked roots of the mandrake resembles the human body with extended arms and legs.

<h3>Water at Massa and Meribah</h3>
<p>
<span class="verse Exod_17_1" data-osis="Exod.17.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>The<span class="note"><span class="key">1</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> This is the famous story telling how the people rebelled against Yahweh when they thirsted, saying that Moses had brought them out into the wilderness to kill them by thirst, and how Moses with the staff brought water from the rock. As a result of this the name was called Massa and Meribah because of the testing and the striving. It was a challenge to Moses&#8217; leadership as well as a test of Yahweh&#8217;s presence. The narrative in its present form serves an important point in the argument of the book. The story turns on the gracious provision of God who can give his people water when there is none available. The narrative is structured to show how the people strove. Thus, the story intertwines God&#8217;s free flowing grace with the sad memory of Israel&#8217;s sins. The passage can be divided into three parts: the situation and the complaint (1-3), the cry and the miracle (4-6), and the commemoration by naming (7).<br /></span></span> <span class="w H3605" data-lemma="H3605">whole</span> <span class="w H5712" data-lemma="H5712">community</span><span class="note"><span class="key">2</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;congregation&#8221; (KJV, ASV, NASB, NRSV).<br /></span></span>   of the <span class="w H3478 H1121" data-lemma="H3478 H1121">Israelites</span> <span class="w H5265" data-lemma="H5265">traveled</span> on their <span class="w H4550" data-lemma="H4550">journey</span><span class="note"><span class="key">3</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The text says that they journeyed &#8220;according to their journeyings.&#8221; Since the verb form (and therefore the derived noun) essentially means to pull up the tent pegs and move along, this verse would be saying that they traveled by stages, or, from place to place.<br /></span></span>   from the <span class="w H4057" data-lemma="H4057">Desert</span> of <span class="w H5512" data-lemma="H5512">Sin</span> <span class="w H5921" data-lemma="H5921">according to</span> the <span class="w H3068" data-lemma="H3068">Lord’s</span> <span class="w H6310" data-lemma="H6310">instruction</span>,  and they <span class="w H2583" data-lemma="H2583">pitched camp</span> in <span class="w H7508" data-lemma="H7508">Rephidim</span>.<span class="note"><span class="key">4</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> The location is a bit of a problem. <ref id="2028-2029">Exod 19:1-2</ref> suggests that it is near Sinai, whereas it is normally located near Kadesh in the north. Without any details provided, M. Noth concludes that two versions came together (<i>Exodus</i> [OTL], 138). S. R. Driver says that the writer wrote not knowing that they were 24 miles apart (<i>Exodus</i>, 157). Critics have long been bothered by this passage because of the two names given at the same place. If two sources had been brought together, it is not possible now to identify them. But Noth insisted that if there were two names there were two different locations. The names Massah and Meribah occur alone in Scripture (<ref id="5180">Deut 9:22</ref>, and <ref id="4313">Num 20:1</ref> for examples), but together in Ps 95 and in <ref id="5819">Deut 33:8</ref>. But none of these passages is a clarification of the difficulty. Most critics would argue that Massah was a secondary element that was introduced into this account, because Exod 17 focuses on Meribah. From that starting point they can diverge greatly on the interpretation, usually having something to do with a water test. But although Num 20 is parallel in several ways, there are major differences: 1) it takes place 40 years later than this, 2) the name Kadesh is joined to the name Meribah there, and 3) Moses is punished there. One must conclude that if an event could occur twice in similar ways (complaint about water would be a good candidate for such), then there is no reason a similar name could not be given.<br /></span></span>   <span class="t1">Now<span class="note"><span class="key">5</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The disjunctive <i>vav</i> introduces a parenthetical clause that is essential for this passage &#8211; there was no water.<br /></span></span> </span> there was <span class="w H369" data-lemma="H369">no</span> <span class="w H4325" data-lemma="H4325">water</span> for the <span class="w H5971" data-lemma="H5971">people</span> to <span class="w H8354" data-lemma="H8354">drink</span>.<span class="note"><span class="key">6</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> Here the construction uses a genitive after the infinitive construct for the subject: &#8220;there was no water for the drinking of the people&#8221; (GKC 353-54 &#167;115.<i>c</i>).<br /></span></span>   </span>

By doubting that God was truly in their midst, and demanding that he demonstrate his presence, they tested him to see if he would act. There are times when &#8220;proving&#8221; God is correct and required, but that is done by faith (as with Gideon); when it is done out of unbelief, then it is an act of disloyalty.<br /></span></span>   the <span class="w H3068" data-lemma="H3068">Lord</span>?”  </span>

Jacob (<i>Exodus</i>, 479-80) says that all these are answered when it is recalled that they were putting God to the test. So water from the rock, the most impossible thing, cleared up the question of his power. Doing it at Horeb was significant because there Moses was called and told he would bring them to this place. Since they had doubted God was in their midst, he would not do this miracle in the camp, but would have Moses lead the elders out to Horeb. If people doubt God is in their midst, then he will choose not to be in their midst. And striking the rock recalled striking the Nile; there it brought death to Egypt, but here it brought life to Israel. There could be little further doubting that God was with them and able to provide for them.<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H6440" data-lemma="H6440">before</span> you <span class="w H8033" data-lemma="H8033">there</span> <span class="w H5921" data-lemma="H5921">on</span><span class="note"><span class="key">19</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;by&#8221; (NIV, NLT).<br /></span></span>   the <span class="w H6697" data-lemma="H6697">rock</span> in <span class="w H2722" data-lemma="H2722">Horeb</span>,  and you will <span class="w H5221" data-lemma="H5221">strike</span><span class="note"><span class="key">20</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The form is a Hiphil perfect with the <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive; it follows the future nuance of the participle and so is equivalent to an imperfect tense nuance of instruction.<br /></span></span>   the <span class="w H6697" data-lemma="H6697">rock</span>,  and <span class="w H4325" data-lemma="H4325">water</span> will <span class="w H3318" data-lemma="H3318">come out</span> <span class="w H4480" data-lemma="H4480">of</span> it so that the <span class="w H5971" data-lemma="H5971">people</span> may <span class="w H8354" data-lemma="H8354">drink</span>.”<span class="note"><span class="key">21</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> These two verbs are also perfect tenses with <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive: &#8220;and [water] will go out&#8230;and [the people] will drink.&#8221; But the second verb is clearly the intent or the result of the water gushing from the rock, and so it may be subordinated.<br /><br/></br><b>sn</b> The presence of Yahweh at this rock enabled Paul to develop a midrashic lesson, an analogical application: Christ was present with Israel to provide water for them in the wilderness.

<h3>Victory over the Amalekites</h3>

<span class="verse Exod_17_8" data-osis="Exod.17.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="w H6002" data-lemma="H6002">Amalek</span><span class="note"><span class="key">24</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> This short passage gives the first account of Israel&#8217;s holy wars. The war effort and Moses&#8217; holding up his hands go side by side until the victory is won and commemorated. Many have used this as an example of intercessory prayer &#8211; but the passage makes no such mention. In Exodus so far the staff of God is the token of the power of God; when Moses used it, God demonstrated his power. To use the staff of God was to say that God did it; to fight without the staff was to face defeat. Using the staff of God was a way of submitting to and depending on the power of God in all areas of life. The first part of the story reports the attack and the preparation for the battle (8,9). The second part describes the battle and its outcome (10-13).

<h3>Israel's Sin with the Moabite Women</h3>

In the overall plan of the book, here we have another possible threat to God&#8217;s program, although here it comes from within the camp (Balaam was the threat from without). If the Moabites could not defeat them one way, they would try another. The chapter has three parts: fornication (<ref id="4473-4475">vv. 1-3</ref>), God&#8217;s punishment (<ref id="4476-4481">vv. 4-9</ref>), and aftermath (<ref id="99999-4490">vv. 10-18</ref>).

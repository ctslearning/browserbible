Toy explains the meaning by saying it affirms that the divine anger against sin is turned away and man&#8217;s relation to God is as though he had not sinned (<i>Proverbs</i> [ICC], 322).

Faithfulness to the <sc>Lord</sc> brings freedom from sin. The verse uses synonymous parallelism with a variant: One half speaks of atonement for sin because of the life of faith, and the other of avoidance of sin because of the fear of the <sc>Lord</sc>.<br /></span></span>   </span>

The life that is pleasing to God will be above reproach and find favor with others. Some would interpret this to mean that God makes his enemies to be at peace with him (cf.

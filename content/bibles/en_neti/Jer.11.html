<h3>The People Have Violated Their Covenant with God</h3>
<p>

This plus the fact that the whole clause &#8220;listen to the terms of this covenant&#8221; is nearly repeated at the end of <ref id="19230">v. 3</ref> has led many modern scholars to delete the whole clause (cf., e.g. W. McKane, <i>Jeremiah</i> [ICC], <ref id="1-1">1:236-37</ref>). However, this only leads to further adjustments in the rest of the verse which are difficult to justify. The form has also led to a good deal of speculation about who these others were that are initially addressed here. The juxtaposition of second plural and singular forms has a precedent in Deuteronomy, where the nation is sometimes addressed with the plural and at other times with a collective singular.<br /></span></span>   the <span class="w H1697" data-lemma="H1697">terms</span> of the <span class="w H1285" data-lemma="H1285">covenant</span><span class="note"><span class="key">3</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> <i>The covenant</i> <i>I made with Israel</i>. Apart from the legal profession and Jewish and Christian tradition the term &#8220;covenant&#8221; may not be too familiar. There were essentially three kinds of &#8220;covenants&#8221; that were referred to under the Hebrew term used here: (1) &#8220;Parity treaties&#8221; or &#8220;covenants&#8221; between equals in which each party pledged itself to certain agreed upon stipulations and took an oath to it in the name of their god or gods (cf. <ref id="918-928">Gen 31:44-54</ref>); (2) &#8220;Suzerain-vassal treaties&#8221; or &#8220;covenants&#8221; in which a great king pledged himself to protect the vassal&#8217;s realm and his right to rule over his own domain in exchange for sovereignty over the vassal, including the rendering of absolute loyalty and submission to the great king&#8217;s demands spelled out in detailed stipulations; (3) &#8220;Covenants of grant&#8221; in which a great king granted to a loyal servant or vassal king permanent title to a piece of land or dominion over a specified realm in recognition of past service. It is generally recognized that the Mosaic covenant which is being referred to here is of the second type and that it resembles in kind the ancient Near Eastern suzerain-vassal treaties. These treaties typically contained the following elements: (1) a preamble identifying the great king (cf. <ref id="2054">Exod 20:2</ref>a; <ref id="4894-4897">Deut 1:1-4</ref>); (2) a historical prologue summarizing the great king&#8217;s past benefactions as motivation for future loyalty (cf. <ref id="2054">Exod 20:2</ref>b; Deut 1:5&#8211;4:43); (3) the primary stipulation of absolute and unconditional loyalty (cf. <ref id="2055-2060">Exod 20:3-8</ref>; Deut 5:1&#8211;11:32); (4) specific stipulations governing future relations between the vassal and the great king and the vassal&#8217;s relation to other vassals (cf. Exod 20:22&#8211;23:33; Deut 12:1&#8211;26:15); (5) the invoking of curses on the vassal for disloyalty and the pronouncing of blessing on him for loyalty (cf. Lev 26; Deut 27-28); (6) the invoking of witnesses to the covenant, often the great king&#8217;s and the vassal&#8217;s gods (cf. <ref id="5728, 5757">Deut 30:19; 31:28</ref> where the reference is to the &#8220;heavens and the earth&#8221; as enduring witnesses). It is also generally agreed that the majority of the threats of punishment by the prophets refer to the invocation of these covenant curses for disloyalty to the basic stipulation, that of absolute loyalty.<br /></span></span>   I <span class="t1">made</span> with Israel<span class="note"><span class="key">4</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;this covenant.&#8221; The referent of &#8220;this&#8221; is left dangling until it is further defined in <ref id="19230-19231">vv. 3-4</ref>.

This refers to the Mosaic law which was instituted at Sinai and renewed on the Plains of Moab before Israel entered into the land. The words &#8220;the terms of the covenant&#8221; are explicitly used for the Ten Commandments in <ref id="2525">Exod 34:28</ref> and for the additional legislation given in <ref id="99999, 5688">Deut 28:69; 29:8</ref>. The formulation here is reminiscent of <ref id="5689-5694">Deut 29:9-14</ref> (<ref id="19646-19651">29:10-15</ref> HT). The book of Deuteronomy is similar in its structure and function to an ancient Near Eastern treaty. In these the great king reminded his vassal of past benefits that he had given to him, charged him with obligations (the terms or stipulations of the covenant) chief among which was absolute loyalty and sole allegiance, promised him future benefits for obeying the stipulations (the blessings), and placed him under a curse for disobeying them. Any disobedience was met with stern warnings of punishment in the form of destruction and exile. Those who had witnessed the covenant were called in to confirm the continuing goodness of the great king and the disloyalty of the vassal. The vassal was then charged with a list of particular infringements of the stipulations and warned to change his actions or suffer the consequences. This is the background for <ref id="19228-19236">Jer 11:1-9</ref>. Jeremiah is here functioning as a messenger from the <sc>Lord</sc>, Israel&#8217;s great king, and charging both the fathers and the children with breach of covenant.<br /></span></span>   </span>

This figure is not common in contemporary English literature or conversation and translating literally would lead to confusion on the part of some readers. Hence, the translation retains the third person in keeping with the rest of the context. The shift from singular &#8220;your cities&#8221; to plural &#8220;you have set up&#8221; is interpreted contextually to refer to a shift in addressing Judah to addressing the citizens of Jerusalem whose streets are being talked about. The appositional clause, &#8220;altars to sacrifice to Baal&#8221; has been collapsed with the preceding clause to better identify what the shameful thing is and to eliminate a complex construction. The length of this sentence runs contrary to the usual practice of breaking up long complex sentences in Hebrew into shorter equivalent ones in English. However, breaking up this sentence and possibly losing the connecting link with the preceding used to introduce it might lead to misunderstanding.<br /></span></span> </span>

The text reads somewhat literally either &#8220;her doing the wicked thing the many&#8221; or &#8220;doing it, the wicked thing, the many.&#8221; The text, relationship between words, and meaning of this whole verse have been greatly debated. Wholesale emendation based on the ancient versions is common in both the commentaries and the modern English versions. Many follow the lead of the Greek version which in many cases offers a smoother reading but for that very reason may not be original. The notes that follow will explain some of these emendations but will also attempt to explain the most likely meaning of the MT which is the more difficult and probably the more original text. Since it is presumed to be the original the text will be dealt with in the notes line for line in the MT even though the emendations often relate to more than one line. For example the Greek of the first two lines reads: &#8220;Why has the beloved done abomination in my house?&#8221; This ignores the preposition before &#8220;my beloved&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1491;&#1460;&#1497;&#1491;&#1460;&#1497;</font>, <font face="Scholar">lididi</font>) and treats the form &#8220;her doing&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1464;&#1492;&#1468;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">asotah</font>], Qal infinitive plus suffix) as a finite verb (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1514;&#1464;&#1492;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">astah</font>], Qal perfect third feminine). The forms are similar but the Greek is smoother. Moreover, it is difficult to explain the presence of &#8220;to&#8221; in the MT if the Greek is the original. The Greek text likewise does not have the difficulty that is exhibited in the MT by the word &#8220;the many&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">harabbim</font>). It reads a word for &#8220;vows/votive offerings&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#949;&#8016;&#967;&#945;&#943;</font> [<font face="Greektl">eucai</font>] regularly = <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1456;&#1491;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> [<font face="Scholar">g&#255;darim</font>]) in place of the word &#8220;many&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">harabbim</font>) and takes it as part of a compound subject of the verb in the following line meaning &#8220;take away.&#8221; However, this word is far removed graphically from that in the MT and it would be difficult to explain how the MT arose from it. The Old Latin apparently reads a word for &#8220;fat&#8221; (<font face="Scholar">adipes</font> = <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1458;&#1500;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">khalavim</font>) which is closer in script to the MT and would be more likely original than the Greek. However, both of these resolutions look like attempts to smooth out a difficult text. Because there is no solid support for any single reading, it is probably best to retain the MT&#8217;s &#8220;the many.&#8221; Many do retain it and take it as a second accusative of &#8220;doing it&#8221; and read &#8220;she does the wicked thing with many [i.e., many false gods],&#8221; a use of the accusative which is hard to justify. Another alternative, taking the adjective &#8220;the many&#8221; to modify the noun &#8220;the wicked thing&#8221; is sometimes suggested but is not possible because the adjective is masculine plural and the noun is feminine singular which is contrary to Hebrew style. Hence one cannot read &#8220;she has done many wicked things.&#8221; The present translation follows the suggestion in D. Barth&#233;lemy, ed., <i>Preliminary and Interim Report on the Hebrew Old Testament Text Project</i>, <ref id="99999">4:209</ref>, that it is the subject of the infinitive construct with an object suffix which is anticipatory of the noun &#8220;wickedness&#8221; that follows (cf. GKC 425 &#167;131.<i>m</i>), i.e., &#8220;the many do it, namely the wickedness&#8221; (for the meaning of the noun see BDB 273 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1494;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> 3.b).<br /></span></span>   Can your acts of treachery be so easily <span class="w H5674" data-lemma="H5674">canceled</span> <span class="w H5921" data-lemma="H5921">by</span> <span class="w H6944" data-lemma="H6944">sacred offerings</span><span class="note"><span class="key">38</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The meaning of this line is also uncertain. The Hebrew text reads somewhat literally, &#8220;holy meat they pass over from upon you.&#8221; The question of the subject of the verb is the main problem here. The verb is masculine plural and the only subject available is &#8220;holy meat&#8221; which is singular, a &#8220;they&#8221; which goes back to &#8220;the many,&#8221; or a noun from the end of the preceding line which is combined with &#8220;holy meat.&#8221; The latter is the solution of the Greek version which reads &#8220;Will votive offerings [or pieces of fat (following the Old Latin)] and holy meats take away from you your wickedness?&#8221; However, that resolution has been rejected in the preceding note as smoothing out the difficulties of the first two lines. It also leaves out the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) at the beginning of the following line and takes the noun &#8220;your wickedness&#8221; as the object of the verb. That certainly would make for an easier reading of both this line and the next and the assumption that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> may not be in the text is possible because it could be explained as a double writing of the pronoun on the end of the preceding phrase &#8220;from upon you&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1461;&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1497;&#1460;&#1498;&#1456;</font>, <font face="Scholar">me</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">alayikh</font>). However, besides being the smoother reading it leaves the last line too short poetically. The solution of the UBS, <i>Preliminary Report</i>, <ref id="99999">4:209</ref> is that &#8220;they&#8221; (referring back to &#8220;the many&#8221;?) is the subject. They read: &#8220;so that they carry away from you even sacrificial flesh.&#8221; But who are &#8220;they&#8221; and &#8220;you?&#8221; Is the &#8220;they&#8221; the priests and the &#8220;you&#8221; the people? (See <ref id="7251-7258">1 Sam 2:10-17</ref> for a possible parallel.) This, however, introduces too many unknowns into the text. The translation adopted is based on a revocalization of the form &#8220;from upon you&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1461;&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1497;&#1460;&#1498;&#1456;</font>, <font face="Scholar">me</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">alayikh</font>) to &#8220;your treacherous acts&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1500;&#1464;&#1497;&#1460;&#1498;&#1456;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ma</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">alayikh</font>; for this noun cf.

While this solution does preserve the consonantal text and is accepted here, it should be acknowledged that there is no ancient support for it and the reading of the noun &#8220;treacheries&#8221; in place of the compound preposition &#8220;from upon&#8221; is purely speculative.<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H3588" data-lemma="H3588">that</span> you <span class="w H5937" data-lemma="H5937">take joy</span> in doing <span class="w H7451" data-lemma="H7451">evil</span> even while you make them?<span class="note"><span class="key">39</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for [or when] your wickedness then you rejoice.&#8221; The meaning of this line is uncertain.

The translation retains the MT but rewords it so it makes better sense in English. The translation presupposes that the phrase &#8220;your wickedness&#8221; is the object of the verb &#8220;take joy&#8221; and the adverb &#8220;then&#8221; refers back to the offering of sacred flesh, i.e., &#8220;even then [or at that time]&#8221; as a <i>constructio ad sensum</i>. For a similar use of the adverb (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1494;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">az</font>) compare <ref id="326">Gen 13:7</ref>.

[If it could] then you could rejoice.&#8221; It should be emphasized that the text of the verse is uncertain in a number of places and open to more than one interpretation. However, regardless of which text or interpretation of it is followed, the Masoretic as interpreted here, the Greek as given in the notes, or an emended text based on both, the overall meaning is much the same. Judah has done evil and the <sc>Lord</sc> rejects their superficial attempts to placate him through ritual without change of behavior. The particulars are different; the point is the same.<br /><br/></br><b>sn</b> For the argument of this verse compare the condemnatory questions in <ref id="19129-19131">Jer 7:9-11</ref>.<br /></span></span> </span>

<h3>A Plot Against Jeremiah is Revealed and He Complains of Injustice</h3>

<span class="verse Jer_11_18" data-osis="Jer.11.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>The <span class="w H3068" data-lemma="H3068">Lord</span> gave me <span class="w H3045" data-lemma="H3045">knowledge</span>,  that I might have <span class="w H3045" data-lemma="H3045">understanding</span>.<span class="note"><span class="key">48</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;caused me to know that I might know.&#8221; Many English versions supply an unstated object &#8220;their plots&#8221; which is referred to later in the context (cf. <ref id="19246">v. 19</ref>). The presupposition of this kind of absolute ellipsis is difficult to justify and would create the need for understanding an ellipsis of &#8220;it&#8221; also after &#8220;I knew.&#8221; It is better to see a bipolar use of the verb &#8220;know&#8221; here. For the second use of the verb &#8220;know&#8221; meaning &#8220;have understanding&#8221; see BDB 394 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1464;&#1497;&#1491;&#1463;&#1506;</font> Qal.5.<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H227" data-lemma="H227">Then</span> he <span class="w H7200" data-lemma="H7200">showed</span> me <span class="w H4611" data-lemma="H4611">what the people were doing</span>.<span class="note"><span class="key">49</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Then you showed me their deeds.&#8221; This is another example of the rapid shift in person which is common in Jeremiah. As elsewhere, it has been resolved for the sake of avoiding confusion for the English reader by leveling the referent to the same person throughout. The text again involves an apostrophe, talking about the <sc>Lord</sc> to addressing him.<br /></span></span>   </span>

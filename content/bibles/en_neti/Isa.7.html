It seems to intrude stylistically, interrupting the symmetry of the immediately preceding and following lines. Furthermore, such a long range prophecy lacks punch in the midst of the immediate crisis. After all, even if Israel were destroyed sometime within the next 65 years, a lot could still happen during that time, including the conquest of Judah and the demise of the Davidic family. Finally the significance of the time frame is uncertain. Israel became an Assyrian province within the next 15 years and ceased to exist as a nation. For these reasons many regard the statement as a later insertion, but why a later editor would include the reference to &#8220;65 years&#8221; remains a mystery. Some try to relate the prophecy to the events alluded to in <ref id="12113, 12121">Ezra 4:2, 10</ref>, which refers to how the Assyrian kings Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal settled foreigners in former Israelite territory, perhaps around 670 <sc>b.c.</sc> However, even if the statement is referring to these events, it lacks rhetorical punch in its immediate context and has the earmarks of a later commentary that has been merged with the text in the process of transmission.<br /></span></span>   </span>

Elsewhere in Isaiah the word usually refers to a natural occurrence or an object/person vested with special significance (see <ref id="17826, 18025, 18033, 18383, 18754, 18942">8:18; 19:20; 20:3; 37:30; 55:13; 66:19</ref>).

It is very likely that Isaiah pointed to a woman who was present at the scene of the prophet&#8217;s interview with Ahaz. Isaiah&#8217;s address to the &#8220;house of David&#8221; and his use of second plural forms suggests other people were present, and his use of the second feminine singular verb form (&#8220;you will name&#8221;) later in the verse is best explained if addressed to a woman who is present.<br /></span></span> <span class="w H5959" data-lemma="H5959">young woman</span><span class="note"><span class="key">26</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> Traditionally, &#8220;virgin.&#8221; Because this verse from Isaiah is quoted in <ref id="23168">Matt 1:23</ref> in connection with Jesus&#8217; birth, the Isaiah passage has been regarded since the earliest Christian times as a prophecy of Christ&#8217;s virgin birth. Much debate has taken place over the best way to translate this Hebrew term, although ultimately one&#8217;s view of the doctrine of the virgin birth of Christ is unaffected. Though the Hebrew word used here (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">almah</font>) can sometimes refer to a woman who is a virgin (<ref id="635">Gen 24:43</ref>), it does not carry this meaning inherently. The word is simply the feminine form of the corresponding masculine noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1462;&#1500;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elem</font>, &#8220;young man&#8221;; cf. <ref id="7675, 7753">1 Sam 17:56; 20:22</ref>). The Aramaic and Ugaritic cognate terms are both used of women who are not virgins. The word seems to pertain to age, not sexual experience, and would normally be translated &#8220;young woman.&#8221; The LXX translator(s) who later translated the Book of Isaiah into Greek sometime between the second and first century <sc>b.c.</sc>, however, rendered the Hebrew term by the more specific Greek word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#952;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">parqenos</font>), which does mean &#8220;virgin&#8221; in a technical sense. This is the Greek term that also appears in the citation of <ref id="17797">Isa 7:14</ref> in <ref id="23168">Matt 1:23</ref>. Therefore, regardless of the meaning of the term in the OT context, in the NT Matthew&#8217;s usage of the Greek term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#952;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#962;</font> clearly indicates that from his perspective a virgin birth has taken place.<br /></span></span>   is about to <span class="w H2030" data-lemma="H2030">conceive</span><span class="note"><span class="key">27</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> Elsewhere the adjective <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">harah</font>), when used predicatively, refers to a past pregnancy (from the narrator&#8217;s perspective, <ref id="7317">1 Sam 4:19</ref>), to a present condition (<ref id="393, 1144">Gen 16:11; 38:24</ref>; <ref id="8265">2 Sam 11:5</ref>), and to a conception that is about to occur in the near future (<ref id="6890, 6892">Judg 13:5, 7</ref>). (There is some uncertainty about the interpretation of <ref id="6890, 6892">Judg 13:5, 7</ref>, however. See the notes to those verses.) In <ref id="17797">Isa 7:14</ref> one could translate, &#8220;the young woman is pregnant.&#8221; In this case the woman is probably a member of the royal family. Another option, the one followed in the present translation, takes the adjective in an imminent future sense, &#8220;the young woman is about to conceive.&#8221; In this case the woman could be a member of the royal family, or, more likely, the prophetess with whom Isaiah has sexual relations shortly after this (see <ref id="17811">8:3</ref>).<br /></span></span>   and will give <span class="w H3205" data-lemma="H3205">birth</span> to a <span class="w H1121" data-lemma="H1121">son</span>.

Immanuel seems to have a positive ring to it, sour milk and honey elsewhere symbolize prosperity and blessing (see <ref id="5772-5773">Deut 32:13-14</ref>; <ref id="13344">Job 20:17</ref>), verse 16 announces the defeat of Judah&#8217;s enemies, and verse 17a could be taken as predicting a return to the glorious days of David and Solomon. However, the message turns sour in verses 17b-25. God will be with his people in judgment, as well as salvation. The curds and honey will be signs of deprivation, not prosperity, the relief announced in verse 16 will be short-lived, and the new era will be characterized by unprecedented humiliation, not a return to glory. Because of Ahaz&#8217;s refusal to trust the Lord, potential blessing would be transformed into a curse, just as Isaiah turns an apparent prophecy of salvation into a message of judgment. Because the words &#8220;the king of Assyria&#8221; are rather awkwardly tacked on to the end of the sentence, some regard them as a later addition. However, the very awkwardness facilitates the prophet&#8217;s rhetorical strategy here, as he suddenly turns what sounds like a positive message into a judgment speech. Actually, &#8220;the king of Assyria,&#8221; stands in apposition to the earlier object &#8220;days,&#8221; and specifies who the main character of these coming &#8220;days&#8221; will be.<br /></span></span>    </span>

The metaphors are well chosen, for the Assyrians (symbolized by the bees) were much more powerful and dangerous than the Egyptians (symbolized by the flies). Nevertheless both would put pressure on Judah, for Egypt wanted Judah as a buffer state against Assyrian aggression, while Assyrian wanted it as a base for operations against Egypt.

How would this situation come about and how would it constitute a sign? Before this situation developed, the Israelites and Syrians would be defeated. But then the Lord would usher in a period of time unlike any since the division of the kingdom almost 200 years before. The Assyrians would overrun the land, destroy the crops, and force the people to subsist on goats&#8217; milk and honey. At that time, as the people saw Immanuel eating his sour milk and honey, the Davidic family would be forced to acknowledge that God was indeed with them. He was present with them in the Syrian-Israelite crisis, fully capable of rescuing them; but he was also present with them in judgment, disciplining them for their lack of trust. The moral of the story is quite clear: Failure to appropriate God&#8217;s promises by faith can turn potential blessing into disciplinary judgment.<br /></span></span> </span>

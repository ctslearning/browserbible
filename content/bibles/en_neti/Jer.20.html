<h3>Jeremiah Complains about the Reaction to His Ministry</h3>
<p>
<span class="verse Jer_20_7" data-osis="Jer.20.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="w H3068" data-lemma="H3068">Lord</span>,  you <span class="w H6601" data-lemma="H6601">coerced</span> me into being a prophet, and I <span class="w H6601" data-lemma="H6601">allowed</span> you <span class="w H6601" data-lemma="H6601">to do it</span>.  You <span class="w H2388" data-lemma="H2388">overcame</span> my <span class="t1">resistance</span> and <span class="w H3201" data-lemma="H3201">prevailed over</span> me.<span class="note"><span class="key">11</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The translation is admittedly interpretive but so is every other translation that tries to capture the nuance of the verb rendered here &#8220;coerced.&#8221; Here the Hebrew text reads: &#8220;You [ &#8211; ]ed me and I let myself be [ &#8211; ]ed. You overpowered me and prevailed.&#8221; The value one assigns to [ &#8211; ] is in every case interpretive based on what one thinks the context is referring to. The word is rendered &#8220;deceived&#8221; or &#8220;tricked&#8221; by several English versions (see, e.g., KJV, NASB, TEV, ICV) as though God had misled him. It is rendered &#8220;enticed&#8221; by some (see, e.g., NRSV, NJPS) as though God had tempted him with false hopes. Some go so far as to accuse Jeremiah of accusing God of metaphorically &#8220;raping&#8221; him. It is true that the word is used of &#8220;seducing&#8221; a virgin in <ref id="2129">Exod 22:15</ref> and that it is used in several places to refer to &#8220;deceiving&#8221; someone with false words (<ref id="17108">Prov 24:28</ref>; <ref id="15150">Ps 78:36</ref>). It is also true that it is used of &#8220;coaxing&#8221; someone to reveal something he does not want to (<ref id="6925, 6955">Judg 14:15; 16:5</ref>) and of &#8220;enticing&#8221; someone to do something on the basis of false hopes (<ref id="9501-9503">1 Kgs 22:20-22</ref>; <ref id="16411">Prov 1:10</ref>). However, it does not always have negative connotations or associations. In <ref id="22120">Hos 2:14</ref> (<ref id="18982">2:16</ref> HT) God &#8220;charms&#8221; or &#8220;woos&#8221; Israel, his estranged &#8216;wife,&#8217; into the wilderness where he hopes to win her back to himself. What Jeremiah is alluding to here is crucial for translating and interpreting the word. There is no indication in this passage that Jeremiah is accusing God of misleading him or raising false hopes; God informed him at the outset that he would encounter opposition (<ref id="18964-18966">1:17-19</ref>). Rather, he is alluding to his call to be a prophet, a call which he initially resisted but was persuaded to undertake because of God&#8217;s persistence (<ref id="18954-18957">Jer <ref id="18954-18957">1:7-10</ref></ref>). The best single word to translate &#8216;&#8230;&#8217; with is thus &#8220;persuaded&#8221; or &#8220;coerced.&#8221; The translation spells out the allusion explicitly so the reader is not left wondering about what is being alluded to when Jeremiah speaks of being &#8220;coerced.&#8221; The translation &#8220;I let you do it&#8221; is a way of rendering the Niphal of the same verb which must be tolerative rather than passive since the normal passive for the Piel would be the Pual (See <i>IBHS</i> 389-90 &#167;23.4g for discussion and examples.). The translation &#8220;you overcame my resistance&#8221; is based on allusion to the same context (1:7-10) and the parallel use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1494;&#1463;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khazaq</font>) as a transitive verb with a direct object in <ref id="9306">1 Kgs 16:22</ref>.<br /></span></span> <span class="w H3117" data-lemma="H3117">Now</span> I have <span class="w H1961" data-lemma="H1961">become</span> a constant <span class="w H7814" data-lemma="H7814">laughingstock</span>.  <span class="w H3605" data-lemma="H3605">Everyone</span> <span class="w H3932" data-lemma="H3932">ridicules</span> me. </span>

Some have seen the phrase here not as Jeremiah&#8217;s ejaculation of terror but of his assailant&#8217;s taunts of his message or even their taunting nickname for him. But comparison of this passage with the first two lines of <ref id="14345">Ps 31:13</ref> (<ref id="19706">31:14</ref> HT) which are word for word the same as these two will show that it refers to the terror inspired by the plots of his enemies to do away with him. It is also clear from the context of that passage and the following context here that the &#8220;whispering of many&#8221; (the literal translation of &#8220;many whispering words of intrigue against me) refers to intrigues to take vengeance on him and do away with him.<br /></span></span>   They are saying, “Come on, let’s <span class="w H5046" data-lemma="H5046">publicly</span> <span class="w H5046" data-lemma="H5046">denounce</span> him!”<span class="note"><span class="key">21</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Denounce and let us denounce him.&#8221; The verb which is translated &#8220;denounce&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1490;&#1463;&#1491;</font>, <font face="Scholar">nagad</font>) does not take an accusative object of person as it does here very often.

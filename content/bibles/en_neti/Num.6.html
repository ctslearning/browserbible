We know the actual meanings of the words, and the combination must form a merism here, meaning no part of the grape could be eaten. Abstaining from these common elements of food was to be a mark of commitment to the <sc>Lord</sc>. <ref id="22130">Hos 3:1</ref> even denounces the raisin cakes as part of a pagan world, and eating them would be a violation of the oath.<br /></span></span>   </span>

<span class="verse Num_6_24" data-osis="Num.6.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>“The <span class="w H3068" data-lemma="H3068">Lord</span> <span class="w H1288" data-lemma="H1288">bless</span> you<span class="note"><span class="key">60</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The short blessing uses the jussive throughout, here the Piel jussive with a pronominal suffix. While the jussive has quite a range of nuances, including wish, desire, prayer, or greeting, the jussives here are stronger. The formal subject of the verb is the <sc>Lord</sc>, and the speaker pronouncing the blessing is the priest, notably after emerging from the holy of holies where atonement has been made. The <sc>Lord</sc> says in this passage that when the priest says this, then the <sc>Lord</sc> will bless them. The jussive then is an oracle, not a wish or a prayer. It is a declaration of what the <sc>Lord</sc> imparts. It is as binding and sure as a patriarchal blessing which once said officially could not be taken back. The priest here is then pronouncing the word of the <sc>Lord</sc>, declaring to the congregation the outcome of the atonement.<br /></span></span>  and <span class="w H8104" data-lemma="H8104">protect</span><span class="note"><span class="key">61</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The verb &#8220;to keep&#8221; concerns the divine protection of the people; its basic meaning is &#8220;to exercise great care over,&#8221; &#8220;to guard,&#8221; or &#8220;to give attention to&#8221; (see <i>TWOT</i> <ref id="99999">2:939</ref>). No doubt the priestly blessing informed the prayer and promise that makes up Ps 121, for the verb occurs six times in the eight verses. So in addition to the divine provision (&#8220;bless&#8221; basically means &#8220;enrich&#8221; in a number of ways) there is the assurance of divine protection.<br /></span></span>   you; </span>

In this second line and the following third, the blessing takes the form of an emblem followed by the truth. For the <sc>Lord</sc> to make his face shine on them would mean to be gracious to them. M. Noth rightly calls this image of the shining face &#8220;a figure of speech for benevolence and favour&#8221; (<i>Numbers</i> [OTL], 59); see, for example, <ref id="13973, 14349, 14576, 14896, 15203, 15207, 15207, 16034">Pss 4:7; 31:17; 44:4; 67:2; 80:4, 8, 20; 119:135</ref>; <ref id="22006">Dan 9:17</ref>). The image may have its inspiration in the theophanies. The picture is of divine favor &#8211; the beaming face of a parent for his beloved.<br /></span></span> </span>

The idea of the fallen face is one of anger (see <ref id="86, 87">Gen 4:6,7</ref>); and the idea of the hidden face is that of withholding support, favor, or peace (see <ref id="5747">Deut 31:18</ref>; <ref id="14328">Ps 30:8</ref>; <ref id="14597">Ps 44:25</ref>).

The pronouncing of the name of Yahweh in this context over the people was taken to be the effectual means of blessings. &#8220;Putting the name on them&#8221; is an expression that emphasizes the truth that he is their God and they are his people or that having his name is having his blessing.<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H5921" data-lemma="H5921">on</span> the <span class="w H3478 H1121" data-lemma="H3478 H1121">Israelites</span>,  and <span class="w H589" data-lemma="H589">I</span> will <span class="w H1288" data-lemma="H1288">bless</span> them.” </span>

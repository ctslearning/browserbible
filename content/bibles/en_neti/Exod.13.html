<h3>The Law of the Firstborn</h3>
<p>
<span class="verse Exod_13_1" data-osis="Exod.13.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>The<span class="note"><span class="key">1</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> This next section seems a little confusing at first glance: <ref id="1869">vv. 1</ref> and 2 call for the dedication of the firstborn, then <ref id="1871-1878">vv. 3-10</ref> instruct concerning the ritual of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, and then <ref id="1869-1884">vv. 11-16</ref> return to the firstborn. B. Jacob (<i>Exodus</i>, 360) explains that <ref id="1871-1884">vv. 3-16</ref> contain a sermon, in which Moses &#8220;began his speech by reminding the people of the events which had just occurred and how they would be recalled by them in the future,&#8221; and then he explained the rulings that went along with it. So the first two verses state the core of the sermon, a new command calling for the redeemed (firstborn) to be sanctified. The second portion stresses that God requires the redeemed to remember their redemption by purifying themselves (3-10). The third section (11-16) develops the theme of dedication to Yahweh. The point is that in view of God&#8217;s mighty redemption, the redeemed (represented by the firstborn) must be set apart for Yahweh&#8217;s service.<br /></span></span> <span class="w H3068" data-lemma="H3068">Lord</span> <span class="w H1696" data-lemma="H1696">spoke</span><span class="note"><span class="key">2</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and Yahweh spoke.&#8221;<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H413" data-lemma="H413">to</span> <span class="w H4872" data-lemma="H4872">Moses:</span>  </span>

In many cases, he continues, it is the spirit that kills and the letter makes alive &#8211; because people who argue against a literal usage do so to excuse lack of action.

S. Childs, <i>Exodus</i> [OTL], 217).<br /><br/></br><b>sn</b> The translation of this name as &#8220;Red Sea&#8221; comes from the sea&#8217;s Greek name in the LXX and elsewhere. The Red Sea on today&#8217;s maps is farther south, below the Sinai Peninsula. But the title Red Sea in ancient times may very well have covered both the Gulf of Suez and the Gulf of Aqaba (see <ref id="4894">Deut 1:1</ref>; <ref id="9078">1 Kgs 9:26</ref>). The name &#8220;Sea of Reeds&#8221; in various English versions (usually in the form of a marginal note) and commentaries reflects the meaning of the Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;</font> a word for reedy water plants (<ref id="1558, 1560">Exod 2:3, 5</ref>; <ref id="18011">Isa 19:6</ref>; <ref id="22555">Jonah 2:6</ref> [Eng. <ref id="1873">v. 5</ref>]) that may have a connection with an Egyptian word used for papyrus and other marsh plants. On this basis some have taken the term Yam Suph as perhaps referring to Lake Menzaleh or Lake Ballah, which have abundant reeds, north of the extension of the Red Sea on the western side of Sinai. Whatever exact body of water is meant, it was not merely a marshy swamp that the people waded through, but a body of water large enough to make passage impossible without divine intervention, and deep enough to drown the Egyptian army. Lake Menzaleh has always been deep enough to preclude passage on foot (E. H. Merrill, <i>Kingdom of Priests</i>, 66). Among the many sources dealing with the geography, see B. F. Batto, &#8220;The Reed Sea: Requiescat in Pace,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 102 (1983): 27-35; M. Waxman, &#8220;I Miss the Red Sea,&#8221; <i>Conservative Judaism</i> 18 (1963): 35-44; G.

Unfortunately, it is a rare word with uncertain meaning. Most translations have something to do with &#8220;in battle array&#8221; or &#8220;prepared to fight&#8221; if need be (cf. <ref id="5866, 5923">Josh 1:14; 4:12</ref>).

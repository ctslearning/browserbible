For a good discussion of the options see F. B. Huey, <i>Jeremiah, Lamentations</i> (NAC), 341, n. 71. Most commentaries follow the general lead of J. Bright (<i>Jeremiah</i> [AB], 243) as the present translation has done here. However, the second name is not emended on the basis of <ref id="19937">v. 13</ref> as Bright does, nor is the second Nergal-Sharezer regarded as the same man as the first and the information on the two combined as he does. The first Nergal-Sharezer is generally identified on the basis of Babylonian records as the man who usurped the throne from Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s son, Awel-Marduk or Evil-Merodach as he is known in the OT (<ref id="20308">Jer 52:31</ref>; <ref id="10250">2 Kgs 25:27</ref>). The present translation renders the two technical Babylonian terms &#8220;Rab-Saris&#8221; (only in <ref id="19927, 19937">Jer 39:3, 13</ref>; <ref id="10042">2 Kgs 18:17</ref>) and &#8220;Rab-Mag&#8221; (only in <ref id="19927, 19937">Jer 39:3, 13</ref>) as &#8220;chief officer&#8221; and &#8220;high official&#8221; without knowing precisely what offices they held. This has been done to give the modern reader some feeling of their high position without specifying exactly what their precise positions were (i.e., the generic has been used for the [unknown] specific).<br /></span></span>   and <span class="w H3605" data-lemma="H3605">all</span> the <span class="w H7611" data-lemma="H7611">other</span> <span class="w H8269" data-lemma="H8269">officers</span> of the <span class="w H4428" data-lemma="H4428">king</span> of <span class="w H894 H894" data-lemma="H894 H894">Babylon</span> <span class="w H935" data-lemma="H935">came</span> and <span class="w H3427" data-lemma="H3427">set up quarters</span><span class="note"><span class="key">4</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;sat.&#8221; The precise meaning of this phrase is not altogether clear, but J.

His father was the man who spoke up for Jeremiah when he was accused of being a false prophet by some of the priests and prophets (<ref id="19597">26:24</ref>). His grandfather was the royal secretary under Josiah who brought the discovery of the book of the law to Josiah&#8217;s attention, read it to him, and was involved in helping Josiah institute his reforms (<ref id="10154-10156">2 Kgs 22:8-10</ref>).<br /></span></span>   the <span class="w H1121" data-lemma="H1121">son</span> of <span class="w H296" data-lemma="H296">Ahikam</span> and the <span class="w H1121" data-lemma="H1121">grandson</span> of <span class="w H8227" data-lemma="H8227">Shaphan</span>,   <span class="w H413" data-lemma="H413">to</span> <span class="w H3947" data-lemma="H3947">take</span> him <span class="w H1004" data-lemma="H1004">home</span> with him.<span class="note"><span class="key">25</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The meaning of the last phrase is uncertain.

The fact that Nebuzaradan later offers Jeremiah the option of going back to Gedaliah (<ref id="19947">40:5</ref>) suggests that the house is here Gedaliah&#8217;s where Jeremiah would be looked out for in accord with Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s command (<ref id="19936">v. 12</ref>).<br /></span></span>  But Jeremiah <span class="w H3427" data-lemma="H3427">stayed</span> <span class="w H8432" data-lemma="H8432">among</span> the <span class="w H5971" data-lemma="H5971">people</span>.<span class="note"><span class="key">26</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> Many translate this last clause as a conclusion or summary remark, &#8220;So Jeremiah stayed&#8230;&#8221; However, it is better to translate it as an adversative because it probably refers to the fact that rather than staying with Gedaliah in the governor&#8217;s residence Jeremiah stayed among the people. That is how he wound up being led off as a prisoner to Ramah. See further the study note on <ref id="19943">40:1</ref>. According to <i>IBHS</i> 550 &#167;33.2.1d the <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive can have either of these values (see examples 11 and 12 for the adversative or contrastive nuance).<br /></span></span>    </span>

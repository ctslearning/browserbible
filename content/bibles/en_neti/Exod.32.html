<h3>The Sin of the Golden Calf</h3>
<p>
<span class="verse Exod_32_1" data-osis="Exod.32.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>When<span class="note"><span class="key">1</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> This narrative is an unhappy interlude in the flow of the argument of the book. After the giving of the Law and the instructions for the tabernacle, the people get into idolatry. So this section tells what the people were doing when Moses was on the mountain. Here is an instant violation of the covenant that they had just agreed to uphold. But through it all Moses shines as the great intercessor for the people. So the subject matter is the sin of idolatry, its effects and its remedy. Because of the similarities to Jeroboam&#8217;s setting up the calves in Dan and Bethel, modern critics have often said this passage was written at that time. U. Cassuto shows how the language of this chapter would not fit an Iron Age setting in Dan. Rather, he argues, this story was well enough known for Jeroboam to imitate the practice (<i>Exodus</i>, 407-10). This chapter can be divided into four parts for an easier exposition: idolatry (<ref id="2440-2445">32:1-6</ref>), intercession (<ref id="2446-2453">32:7-14</ref>), judgment (<ref id="2454-2468">32:15-29</ref>), intercession again (<ref id="2469-2480">32:30-33:6</ref>). Of course, these sections are far more complex than this, but this gives an overview. Four summary statements for expository points might be: I. Impatience often leads to foolish violations of the faith, II. Violations of the covenant require intercession to escape condemnation, III. Those spared of divine wrath must purge evil from their midst, and IV. Those who purge evil from their midst will find reinstatement through intercession. Several important studies are available for this. See, among others, D. R. Davis, &#8220;Rebellion, Presence, and Covenant: A Study in Exodus 32-34,&#8221; <i>WTJ</i> 44 (1982): 71-87; M.

Jacob (<i>Exodus</i>, 937-38) argues that Aaron simply did not have the resolution that Moses did, and wanting to keep peace he gave in to the crowd. He also tries to explain that Aaron was wanting to show their folly through the deed. U. Cassuto also says that Aaron&#8217;s request for the gold was a form of procrastination, but that the people quickly did it and so he had no alternative but to go through with it (<i>Exodus</i>, 412). These may be right, since Aaron fully understood what was wrong with this, and what the program was all about. The text gives no strong indication to support these ideas, but there are enough hints from the way Aaron does things to warrant such a conclusion.<br /></span></span> </span>

That is the verb used in <ref id="38">Gen 2:7</ref> for Yahweh God forming the man from the dust of the ground. If it is here, it is the reverse, a human &#8211; the dust of the ground &#8211; trying to form a god or gods. The active participle of this verb in Hebrew is &#8220;the potter.&#8221; A related noun is the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1461;&#1510;&#1468;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (<i>yetser</i>), &#8220;evil inclination,&#8221; the wicked designs or intent of the human heart (<ref id="143">Gen 6:5</ref>). But see the discussion by B. S. Childs (<i>Exodus</i> [OTL], 555-56) on a different reading, one that links the root to a hollow verb meaning &#8220;to cast out of metal&#8221; (as in <ref id="8950">1 Kgs 7:15</ref>).<br /></span></span>   it with an <span class="w H2747" data-lemma="H2747">engraving tool</span>,  and <span class="w H6213" data-lemma="H6213">made</span> a <span class="w H4541" data-lemma="H4541">molten</span> <span class="w H5695" data-lemma="H5695">calf</span>.<span class="note"><span class="key">14</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> The word means a &#8220;young bull&#8221; and need not be translated as &#8220;calf&#8221; (although &#8220;calf&#8221; has become the traditional rendering in English). The word could describe an animal three years old. Aaron probably made an inner structure of wood and then, after melting down the gold, plated it. The verb &#8220;molten&#8221; does not need to imply that the image was solid gold; the word is used in <ref id="18240">Isa 30:22</ref> for gold plating.

On the surface it would seem that with the festival there would be singing and dancing, so that the people were celebrating even though they did not know the reason. W. C. Kaiser says the word means &#8220;drunken immoral orgies and sexual play&#8221; (&#8220;Exodus,&#8221; <i>EBC</i> <ref id="99999">2:478</ref>). That is quite an assumption for this word, but is reflected in some recent English versions (e.g., NCV &#8220;got up and sinned sexually&#8221;; TEV &#8220;an orgy of drinking and sex&#8221;). The word means &#8220;to play, trifle.&#8221; It can have other meanings, depending on its contexts. It is used of Lot when he warned his sons-in-law and appeared as one who &#8220;mocked&#8221; them; it is also used of Ishmael &#8220;playing&#8221; with Isaac, which Paul interprets as mocking; it is used of Isaac &#8220;playing&#8221; with his wife in a manner that revealed to Abimelech that they were not brother and sister, and it is used by Potiphar&#8217;s wife to say that her husband brought this slave Joseph in to &#8220;mock&#8221; them. The most that can be gathered from these is that it is playful teasing, serious mocking, or playful caresses. It might fit with wild orgies, but there is no indication of that in this passage, and the word does not mean it. The fact that they were festive and playing before an idol was sufficient.<br /></span></span>    </span>

B. S. Childs (<i>Exodus</i> [OTL], 567) reflects the Jewish interpretation that there is a profound paradox in God&#8217;s words. He vows the severest punishment but then suddenly conditions it on Moses&#8217; agreement. &#8220;Let me alone that I may consume them&#8221; is the statement, but the effect is that he has left the door open for intercession. He allows himself to be persuaded &#8211; that is what a mediator is for. God could have slammed the door (as when Moses wanted to go into the promised land).

Here Moses is asking God to repent/relent over the judgment he was about to bring, meaning that he should be moved by such compassion that there would be no judgment like that. J. P.

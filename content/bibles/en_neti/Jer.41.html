The wall was breached in the fourth month (= early July; 39:2) and Nebuzaradan came and burned the palace, the temple, and many of the houses and tore down the wall in the fifth month (= early August; 52:12). That would have left time between the fifth month and the seventh month (October) to gather in the harvest of grapes, dates and figs, and olives (<ref id="19954">40:12</ref>). However, many commentators feel that too much activity takes place in too short a time for this to have been in the same year and posit that it happened the following year or even five years later when a further deportation took place, possibly in retaliation for the murder of Gedaliah and the Babylonian garrison at Mizpah (<ref id="20307">52:30</ref>). The assassination of Gedaliah had momentous consequences and was commemorated in one of the post exilic fast days lamenting the fall of Jerusalem (<ref id="22996">Zech 8:19</ref>).<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H3458" data-lemma="H3458">Ishmael</span>,  the <span class="w H1121" data-lemma="H1121">son</span> of <span class="w H5418" data-lemma="H5418">Nethaniah</span> and <span class="w H1121" data-lemma="H1121">grandson</span> of <span class="w H476" data-lemma="H476">Elishama</span> who was a <span class="w H2233" data-lemma="H2233">member</span> of the <span class="w H4410" data-lemma="H4410">royal</span> family and had been one of <span class="w H4428" data-lemma="H4428">Zedekiah’s</span> <span class="w H7227" data-lemma="H7227">chief officers</span>,  <span class="w H935" data-lemma="H935">came</span> <span class="w H854" data-lemma="H854">with</span> <span class="w H6235" data-lemma="H6235">ten</span> of his <span class="w H376" data-lemma="H376">men</span> <span class="w H413" data-lemma="H413">to</span> <span class="w H1436" data-lemma="H1436">Gedaliah</span> <span class="w H1121" data-lemma="H1121">son</span> of <span class="w H296" data-lemma="H296">Ahikam</span> at <span class="w H4709" data-lemma="H4709">Mizpah</span>.

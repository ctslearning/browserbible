NASB &#8220;in the days when the judges governed (ruled NRSV).&#8221;<br /><b>sn</b> Many interpreters, reading this statement in the light of the Book of Judges which describes a morally corrupt period, assume that the narrator is painting a dark backdrop against which Ruth&#8217;s exemplary character and actions will shine even more brightly. However, others read this statement in the light of the book&#8217;s concluding epilogue which traces the full significance of the story to the time of David, the chosen king of Judah (<ref id="7209-7213">4:18-22</ref>).<br /></span></span>    <span class="w H1961" data-lemma="H1961">there was</span> a <span class="w H7458" data-lemma="H7458">famine</span> in the <span class="w H776" data-lemma="H776">land</span> of Judah.<span class="note"><span class="key">2</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in the land.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;of Judah&#8221; is supplied in the translation to clarify the referent.<br /></span></span> <span class="w H1980" data-lemma="H1980">So</span> a <span class="w H376" data-lemma="H376">man</span> from <span class="w H1035" data-lemma="H1035">Bethlehem</span><span class="note"><span class="key">3</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> The name <i>Bethlehem</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1514; &#1500;&#1462;&#1495;&#1462;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">bet lekhem</font>) is from &#8220;house, place&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1514;</font>) and &#8220;bread, food&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1462;&#1495;&#1462;&#1501;</font>), so the name literally means &#8220;House of Bread&#8221; or &#8220;Place of Food.&#8221; Perhaps there is irony here: One would not expect a severe famine in such a location. This would not necessarily indicate that Bethlehem was under divine discipline, but merely that the famine was very severe, explaining the reason for the family&#8217;s departure.<br /><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map7-E2; Map8-E2; Map10-B4.<br /></span></span>   in <span class="w H3063" data-lemma="H3063">Judah</span> went to live as a <span class="w H1481" data-lemma="H1481">resident foreigner</span><span class="note"><span class="key">4</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;to live temporarily.&#8221; The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gur</font>, &#8220;sojourn&#8221;) may refer to (1) temporary dwelling in a location (<ref id="5391">Deut 18:6</ref>; <ref id="6988">Judg 17:7</ref>) or (2) permanent dwelling in a location (<ref id="6641">Judg 5:17</ref>; <ref id="14375">Ps 33:8</ref>). When used of a foreign land, it can refer to (1) temporary dwelling as a visiting foreigner (<ref id="309, 497, 548">Gen 12:10; 20:1; 21:34</ref>; <ref id="9729-9730">2 Kgs 8:1-2</ref>; <ref id="20025">Jer 44:14</ref>) or (2) permanent dwelling as a resident foreigner (<ref id="1425">Gen 47:4</ref>; <ref id="1660">Exod 6:4</ref>; <ref id="4168">Num 15:14</ref>; <ref id="5572">Deut 26:5</ref>; <ref id="8124">2 Sam 4:3</ref>; <ref id="20146, 20161, 20207">Jer 49:18,33; 50:40</ref>; <ref id="21702-21703">Ezek 47:22-23</ref>). Although Naomi eventually returned to Judah, there is some ambiguity whether or not Elimelech intended the move to make them permanent resident foreigners. Cf. NASB &#8220;to sojourn&#8221; and NIV &#8220;to live for a while,&#8221; both of which imply the move was temporary, while &#8220;to live&#8221; (NCV, NRSV, NLT) is more neutral about the permanence of the relocation.<br /><b>sn</b> Some interpreters view Elimelech&#8217;s departure from Judah to sojourn in Moab as lack of faith in the covenant God of Israel to provide for his family&#8217;s needs in the land of promise; therefore his death is consequently viewed as divine judgment. Others note that God never prohibited his people from seeking food in a foreign land during times of famine but actually sent his people to a foreign land during a famine in Canaan on at least one occasion as an act of deliverance (Gen 37-50). In this case, Elimelech&#8217;s sojourn to Moab was an understandable act by a man concerned for the survival of his family, perhaps even under divine approval, so their death in Moab was simply a tragedy, a bad thing that happened to a godly person.<br /></span></span>   in the <span class="w H7704" data-lemma="H7704">region</span> of <span class="w H4124" data-lemma="H4124">Moab</span>,  along with his <span class="w H802" data-lemma="H802">wife</span> and <span class="w H8147" data-lemma="H8147">two</span> <span class="w H1121" data-lemma="H1121">sons</span>.<span class="note"><span class="key">5</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he and his wife and his two sons.&#8221; The LXX omits &#8220;two.&#8221;<br /></span></span>   </span>

The rate of infant mortality was so high during the Iron Age that parents typically did not name children until they survived infancy and were weaned. Naomi and Elimelech might have named their two sons Mahlon and Kilion to reflect their weak condition in infancy due to famine &#8211; which eventually prompted the move to Moab where food was abundant.<br /></span></span>   They were of the clan of <span class="w H673" data-lemma="H673">Ephrath</span><span class="note"><span class="key">9</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[They were] Ephrathites.&#8221; Ephrathah is a small village (<ref id="16158">Ps 132:6</ref>) in the vicinity of Bethlehem (<ref id="1028">Gen 3<ref id="99999">5:1</ref>6</ref>), so close in proximity that it is often identified with the larger town of Bethlehem (<ref id="1031, 1459">Gen 3<ref id="99999">5:1</ref>9; 48:7</ref>; <ref id="7202">Ruth 4:11</ref>; <ref id="22636">Mic 5:2</ref> [MT 5:1]; <i>HALOT</i> 81 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1508;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1514;&#1464;&#1492;</font>); see F. W. Bush, <i>Ruth,</i> <i>Esther</i> (WBC), 64. The designation &#8220;Ephrathites&#8221; might indicate that they were residents of Ephrathah. However, the adjectival form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1508;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ephratim</font>, &#8220;Ephrathites&#8221;) used here elsewhere refers to someone from the clan of Ephrath (cf. <ref id="10390">1 Chr 4:4</ref>) which lived in the region of Bethlehem: &#8220;Now David was the son of an Ephrathite from Bethlehem in Judah whose name was Jesse&#8221; (<ref id="7631">1 Sam 17:12</ref>; cf. <ref id="22636">Mic 5:2</ref> [MT 5:1]). So it is more likely that the virtually identical expression here &#8211; &#8220;Ephrathites from Bethlehem in Judah&#8221; &#8211; refers to the clan of Ephrath in Bethlehem (see R. L.

The name Ruth (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;</font>, <font face="Scholar">rut</font>) is from the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1456;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">r&#255;</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ut</font>, &#8220;friendship&#8221;), derived from the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1461;&#1506;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rea</font>&#8217;, &#8220;friend, companion&#8221;). Ironically, Orpah will eventually turn her back on Naomi, while Ruth will display extraordinary friendship as her life-long companion (see <ref id="7142">1:14</ref>). Since they seem to mirror the most definitive action of these women, perhaps they designate character types (as is the case with the name <i>Mara</i> in <ref id="7149">1:21</ref> and <i>Peloni Almoni</i> in <ref id="7193">4:2</ref>) rather than their original birth names.<br /></span></span>   And they continued to <span class="w H3427" data-lemma="H3427">live</span> <span class="w H8033" data-lemma="H8033">there</span> about <span class="w H6235" data-lemma="H6235">ten</span> <span class="w H8141" data-lemma="H8141">years</span>.  </span>

Although Naomi and her daughters-in-law had reason for emotional grief, the issue at hand was Naomi&#8217;s lamentable situation, which she did not want them to experience: being a poor widow in a foreign land.<br /></span></span>   is <span class="w H3966" data-lemma="H3966">too much</span> for you to <span class="w H3318" data-lemma="H3318">bear</span>.<span class="note"><span class="key">42</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for there is bitterness to me exceedingly from you.&#8221; The clause <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1470;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;&#1470;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497; &#1502;&#1456;&#1488;&#1465;&#1491; &#1502;&#1460;&#1499;&#1468;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki-mar-li me</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">od mikkem</font>) is notoriously difficult to interpret. It has been taken in three different ways: (1) &#8220;For I am very bitter for me because of you,&#8221; that is, because of your widowed condition (cf. KJV, NKJV, ASV, RSV, NJB, REB, JB, TEV). This does not fit well, however, with the following statement (&#8220;for the LORD has attacked me&#8221;) nor with the preceding statement (&#8220;You must not return with me&#8221;). (2) &#8220;For I am far more bitter than for you&#8221; (cf. NASB, NIV, NJPS, NEB, CEV, NLT). This does not provide an adequate basis, however, for the preceding statement (&#8220;You must not return with me&#8221;). (3) &#8220;For my bitterness is too much for you [to bear]&#8221; (cf. NAB, NRSV, NCV, CEV margin). This is preferable because it fits well with both the preceding and following statements. These three options reflect the three ways the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1503;</font> may be taken here: (1) causal: &#8220;because of, on account of&#8221; (BDB 580 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;</font> 2.f; <i>HALOT</i> 598 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;</font> 6), not that Orpah and Ruth were the cause of her calamity, but that Naomi was grieved because they had become widows; (2) comparative: &#8220;more [bitter] than you&#8221; (BDB 581 s.<ref id="7134">v. 6</ref>.a; <i>HALOT</i> 598 s.<ref id="7133">v. 5</ref>b), meaning that Naomi&#8217;s situation was more grievous than theirs &#8211; while they could remarry, her prospects were much more bleak; and (3) elative, describing a situation that is too much for a person to bear: &#8220;too [bitter] for you&#8221; (BDB 581 s.<ref id="7134">v. 6</ref>.d; <i>HALOT</i> 598 s.<ref id="7133">v. 5</ref>a; <i>IBHS</i> 267 &#167;14.4f; e.g., <ref id="93">Gen 4:13</ref>; <ref id="2018">Exod 18:18</ref>; <ref id="5373">Deut 17:8</ref>; <ref id="9405">1 Kgs 19:17</ref>), meaning that Naomi&#8217;s plight was too bitter for her daughters-in-law to share. While all three options are viable, the meaning adopted must fit two criteria: (1) The meaning of this clause (<ref id="7141">1:13</ref>b) must provide the grounds for Naomi&#8217;s emphatic rejection of the young women&#8217;s refusal to separate themselves from her (<ref id="7141">1:13</ref>a); and (2) it must fit the following clause: &#8220;for the hand of the LORD has gone out against me&#8221; (<ref id="7141">1:13</ref>c). The first and second options do not provide adequate reasons for sending her daughters-in-law back home, nor do they fit her lament that the LORD had attached her (not them); however, the third option (elative sense) fits both criteria. Naomi did not want her daughters-in-law to share her sad situation, that is, to be poor, childless widows in a foreign land with no prospect for marriage. If they accompanied her back to Judah, they would be in the same kind of situation in which she found herself in Moab. If they were to find the &#8220;rest&#8221; (security of home and husband) she wished for them, it would be in Moab, not in Judah. The <sc>Lord</sc> had already deprived her of husband and sons. She could do nothing for them in this regard because she had no more sons to give them as husbands, and she was past the age of child-bearing to raise up new husbands for them in the future &#8211; as if they could wait that long anyway (<ref id="7141">1:13</ref>a). For a discussion of these three options and defense of the approach adopted here, see F. W. Bush, <i>Ruth,</i> <i>Esther</i> (WBC), 80-81.<br /></span></span>    <span class="w H3588" data-lemma="H3588">For</span> the <span class="w H3068" data-lemma="H3068">Lord</span> is <span class="w H3027" data-lemma="H3027">afflicting</span> me!”<span class="note"><span class="key">43</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for the hand of the <sc>Lord</sc> has gone out against me&#8221; (KJV, ASV, NASB, NIV all similar).

In this formula the exact curse is understood but not expressed (GKC 472 &#167;149.<i>d</i>; BDB 462 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1492;</font> 1.b). In ancient Near Eastern imprecations, when the curse was so extreme, it was not uttered because it was unspeakably awful: &#8220;In the twelve uses of this formula, the calamity which the speaker invokes is never named, since OT culture (in keeping with the rest of the ancient Near East) accorded such power to the spoken word&#8221; (F. W. Bush, <i>Ruth,</i> <i>Esther</i> [WBC], 82). Ruth here pronounces a curse upon herself, elevating the preceding promise to a formal, unconditional level. If she is not faithful to her promise, she agrees to become an object of divine judgment. As in other occurrences of this oath/curse formula, the specific punishment is not mentioned. As Bush explains, the particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) here is probably asseverative (&#8220;indeed, certainly&#8221;) and the statement that follows expresses what underscores the seriousness of her promise by invoking divine judgment, as it were, if she does otherwise. Of course, the <sc>Lord</sc> would not have been obligated to judge her if she had abandoned Naomi &#8211; this is simply an ancient idiomatic way of expressing her commitment to her promise.<br /></span></span> </span> Only <span class="w H4194" data-lemma="H4194">death</span> will be able to <span class="w H6504" data-lemma="H6504">separate</span> me from you!”<span class="note"><span class="key">52</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;certainly death will separate me and you.&#8221; Ruth&#8217;s vow has been interpreted two ways: (1) Not even death will separate her from Naomi &#8211; because they will be buried next to one another (e.g., NRSV, NCV; see E. F. Campbell, <i>Ruth</i> [AB], 74-75). However, for the statement to mean, &#8220;Not even death will separate me and you,&#8221; it would probably need to be introduced by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>, &#8220;if&#8221;) or negated by <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lo</font>&#8217;, &#8220;not&#8221;; see F. W. Bush, <i>Ruth,</i> <i>Esther</i> [WBC], 83). (2) Nothing except death will separate her from Naomi (e.g., KJV, ASV, RSV, NASB, NIV, TEV, NJPS, REB, NLT, GW; see Bush, 83). The particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> introduces the content of the vow, which &#8211; if violated &#8211; would bring about the curse uttered in the preceding oath (BDB 472 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> 1.c; e.g., <ref id="1269">Gen 42:16</ref>; <ref id="4131">Num 14:22</ref>; <ref id="7734, 7922, 7974">1 Sam 20:3; 26:16; 29:6</ref>; <ref id="8117">2 Sam 3:35</ref>; <ref id="8794">1 Kgs 2:23</ref>; <ref id="18655">Isa 49:18</ref>). Some suggest that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;</font> is functioning as an asseverative (&#8220;indeed, certainly&#8221;) to express what the speaker is determined <i>will</i> happen (Bush, 83; see <ref id="7553">1 Sam 14:44</ref>; <ref id="8091">2 Sam 3:9</ref>; <ref id="8794, 9390">1 Kgs 2:23; 19:2</ref>). Here <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> probably functions in a conditional sense: &#8220;if&#8221; or &#8220;if&#8230;except, unless&#8221; (BDB 473 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font>2.b). So her vow may essentially mean &#8220;if anything except death should separate me from you!&#8221; The most likely view is (2): Ruth is swearing that death alone will separate her from Naomi.<br /><b>sn</b> Ruth&#8217;s devotion to Naomi is especially apparent here. Instead of receiving a sure blessing and going home (see <ref id="7136">v. 8</ref>), Ruth instead takes on a serious responsibility and subjects herself to potential divine punishment. Death, a power beyond Ruth&#8217;s control, <i>will separate</i> the two women, but until that time Ruth will stay by Naomi&#8217;s side and she will even be buried in the same place as Naomi.<br /></span></span> </span>

In Genesis he blesses the patriarchs with fertility and promises numerous descendants. Outside Genesis he blesses/protects and also takes away life/happiness. In light of Naomi&#8217;s emphasis on God&#8217;s sovereign, malevolent deprivation of her family, one can understand her use of this name for God. For discussion of this divine name, see T. N. D.

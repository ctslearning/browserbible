GKC 311-12 &#167;106.<i>i</i> or <i>IBHS</i> 488-89 &#167;30.5.1d). The words that the <sc>Lord</sc> is about to speak follow in chs. 30&#8211;31.<br /><br/></br><b>sn</b> Reference is made here to the so-called &#8220;Book of Consolation&#8221; which is the most extended treatment of the theme of hope or deliverance in the book. Jeremiah was called to be a prophet both of judgment (of tearing down and destroying) and of deliverance (of replanting and rebuilding; see <ref id="18957">Jer 1:10</ref>). Jeremiah lamented that he had to predominantly pronounce judgment but he has periodically woven in prophecies of hope after judgment in <ref id="19017-19021, 19351-19352, 19488-19493, 19529-19532, 19646-19650, 19668">3:14-18; 16:14-15; 23:3-8; <ref id="19529-19532, 19646-19650">24:4-7; 29:10-14</ref>, 32</ref>. The oracles of hope contained in these chapters are undated but reference is made in them to the restoration of both Israel which had gone into exile in Assyria in 722 <sc>b.c.</sc> and Judah which began to be exiled in 605 and 597 <sc>b.c</sc>. Jeremiah had already written as early as the reign of Zedekiah about the exiles who were the good figs who were to experience the &#8220;good&#8221; of restoration (24:4-7; 29:10-14) and had spoken of the further exile of those who remained in Judah. So it is possible that these oracles fit in roughly the same time frame as chapters 27&#8211;29.<br /></span></span>   </span>

The prophets of both the eighth and seventh century looked forward to this ideal (see, e.g., <ref id="22106">Hos 1:11</ref> (<ref id="18968">2:2</ref> HT); <ref id="17896-17898">Isa 11:11-13</ref>; <ref id="19490-19491, 19671, 19783">Jer 23:5-6; 30:3; 33:7</ref>; <ref id="21413-21420">Ezek 37:15-22</ref>). This has already been anticipated in <ref id="19021">Jer 3:18</ref>.<br /></span></span> </span>

The time referent can be either near or far, referring to something as near as the Assyrian threat in the time of Ahaz (<ref id="17801, 17803, 17804, 17806">Isa 7:18, 20, 21, 23</ref>) or as distant as the eschatological battle of God against Gog when he attacks Israel (<ref id="21440, 21444">Ezek 38:14, 18</ref>). The judgment can be against Israel&#8217;s enemies and result in Israel&#8217;s deliverance (<ref id="20197-20201">Jer 50:30-34</ref>). At other times as here the Day of the <sc>Lord</sc> involves judgment on Israel itself. Here reference is to the judgment that the northern kingdom, Israel, has already experienced (cf., e.g., <ref id="19011">Jer 3:8</ref>) and which the southern kingdom, Judah, is in the process of experiencing and which Jeremiah has lamented over several times and even described in hyperbolic and apocalyptic terms in <ref id="19047-19059">Jer 4:19-31</ref>.<br /></span></span>  There has <span class="w H369" data-lemma="H369">never</span> been any <span class="w H3644" data-lemma="H3644">like</span> it.

Moreover the figure moves from Jacob = descendants of Jacob to only a part of those descendants. Not all of his descendants who have experienced and are now experiencing trouble will be saved. Only a remnant (i.e., the good figs, cf., e.g., <ref id="19488, 19699">Jer 23:3; 31:7</ref>) will see the good things that the <sc>Lord</sc> has in store for them (<ref id="19530-19531">Jer 24:5-6</ref>). The bad figs will suffer destruction through war, starvation, and disease (cf., e.g., <ref id="19533-19535">Jer 24:8-10</ref> among many other references).<br /></span></span> </span>

The end of that servitude has already been referred to in <ref id="19546-19549, 19647-19650">25:11-14; 29:11-14</ref>. Like many other passages in the OT it has been given a later eschatological reinterpretation in the light of subsequent bondages and lack of complete fulfillment, i.e., of restoration to the land and restoration of the Davidic monarchy.<br /></span></span>   I will <span class="w H5423" data-lemma="H5423">deliver</span> you from captivity.<span class="note"><span class="key">18</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will tear off their bands.&#8221; The &#8220;bands&#8221; are the leather straps which held the yoke bars in place (cf. <ref id="19599">27:2</ref>). The metaphor of the &#8220;yoke on the neck&#8221; is continued.

The concept of &#8220;pledging&#8221; something refers to putting up security in guarantee of payment.

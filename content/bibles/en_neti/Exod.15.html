<h3>The Song of Triumph</h3>
<p>
<span class="verse Exod_15_1" data-osis="Exod.15.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="w H227" data-lemma="H227">Then</span><span class="note"><span class="key">1</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> This chapter is a song of praise sung by Moses and the people right after the deliverance from the Sea. The song itself is <ref id="1922">vv. 1</ref>b-18; it falls into three sections &#8211; praise to God (1b-3), the cause for the praise (4-13), and the conclusion (14-18). The point of the first section is that God&#8217;s saving acts inspire praise from his people; the second is that God&#8217;s powerful acts deliver his people from the forces of evil; and the third section is that God&#8217;s demonstrations of his sovereignty inspire confidence in him by his people. So the Victory Song is very much like the other declarative praise psalms &#8211; the resolve to praise, the power of God, the victory over the enemies, the incomparability of God in his redemption, and the fear of the people.

The basic idea of the verb is &#8220;rise up loftily&#8221; or &#8220;proudly.&#8221; But derivatives of the root carry the nuance of majesty or pride (S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, 132). So the idea of the perfect tense with its infinitive absolute may mean &#8220;he is highly exalted&#8221; or &#8220;he has done majestically&#8221; or &#8220;he is gloriously glorious.&#8221;<br /></span></span>   the <span class="w H5483" data-lemma="H5483">horse</span> and its <span class="w H7392" data-lemma="H7392">rider</span><span class="note"><span class="key">6</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> The common understanding is that Egypt did not have people riding horses at this time, and so the phrase <i>the horse and its rider</i> is either viewed as an anachronism or is interpreted to mean charioteers.

Some have suggested changing &#8220;rider&#8221; to &#8220;chariot&#8221; (re-vocalization) to read &#8220;the horse and its chariot.&#8221;<br /></span></span>   he has <span class="w H7411" data-lemma="H7411">thrown</span> into the <span class="w H3220" data-lemma="H3220">sea</span>.  </span>

A meaning of &#8220;power&#8221; fits the line fairly well, forming a hendiadys with strength &#8211; &#8220;strength and power&#8221; becoming &#8220;strong power.&#8221; Similar lines are in <ref id="17903">Isa 12:2</ref> and <ref id="15884">Ps 118:14</ref>.

Few will match the powerful acts that were exhibited in Egypt, but these nonetheless set the tone. The song is certainly typological of the song of the saints in heaven who praise God for delivering them from the bondage of this world by judging the world.

<h3>The Bitter Water</h3>

The event teaches that God is able to turn bitter water into sweet water for his people, and he promises to do such things if they obey. He can provide for them in the desert &#8211; he did not bring them into the desert to let them die. But there is a deeper level to this story &#8211; the healing of the water is incidental to the healing of the people, their lack of trust. The passage is arranged in a neat chiasm, starting with a journey (A), ending with the culmination of the journey (A\'); developing to bitter water (B), resolving to sweet water (B\'); complaints by the people (C), leading to to the instructions for the people (C\'); and the central turning point is the wonder miracle (D).<br /></span></span> <span class="w H4872" data-lemma="H4872">Moses</span> led <span class="w H3478" data-lemma="H3478">Israel</span> to <span class="w H5265" data-lemma="H5265">journey</span><span class="note"><span class="key">58</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The verb form is unusual; the normal expression is with the Qal, which expresses that they journeyed.

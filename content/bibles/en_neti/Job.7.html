<h3>The Brevity of Life</h3>

As a military term it would include the fixed period of duty (the time) and the hard work (toil). Job here is considering the lot of all humans, not just himself.<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H5921" data-lemma="H5921">on</span> earth?

The latter sense may be what is intended here in view of the parallelism, although the next verse seems much broader.<br /></span></span>   </span>

In either case, the expressions in <ref id="13011">v. 2</ref> emphasize the point of the comparison, which will be summed up in <ref id="13012">v. 3</ref>.<br /></span></span>   and like a <span class="w H7916" data-lemma="H7916">hired man</span> <span class="w H6960" data-lemma="H6960">looking</span><span class="note"><span class="key">5</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The two verbs in this verse stress the eager expectation and waiting.

<span class="verse Job_7_3" data-osis="Job.7.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="w H3651" data-lemma="H3651">thus</span><span class="note"><span class="key">7</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> &#8220;Thus&#8221; indicates a summary of <ref id="13010">vv. 1</ref> and 2: like the soldier, the mercenary, and the slave, Job has labored through life and looks forward to death.<br /></span></span>   I have been made to <span class="w H5157" data-lemma="H5157">inherit</span><span class="note"><span class="key">8</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The form is the Hophal perfect of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nakhal</font>): &#8220;I have been made to inherit,&#8221; or more simply, &#8220;I have inherited.&#8221; The form occurs only here. The LXX must have confused the letters or sounds, a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vav</font>) for the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nun</font>), for it reads &#8220;I have endured.&#8221; As a passive the form technically has two accusatives (see GKC 388 &#167;121.<i>c</i>). Job&#8217;s point is that his sufferings have been laid on him by another, and so he has inherited them.<br /></span></span>    <span class="w H3391" data-lemma="H3391">months</span> of <span class="w H7723" data-lemma="H7723">futility</span>,<span class="note"><span class="key">9</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The word is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shav</font>&#8217;, &#8220;vanity, deception, nothingness, futility&#8221;). His whole life &#8211; marked here in months to show its brevity &#8211; has been futile. E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 98) suggests the meaning &#8220;disillusionment,&#8221; explaining that it marks the deceptive nature of mortal life. The word describes life as hollow, insubstantial.<br /></span></span>   and <span class="w H3915" data-lemma="H3915">nights</span> of <span class="w H5999" data-lemma="H5999">sorrow</span><span class="note"><span class="key">10</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> &#8220;Sorrow&#8221; is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">amal</font>), used in <ref id="12915">3:10</ref>. It denotes anxious toil, labor, troublesome effort. It may be that the verse expresses the idea that the nights are when the pains of his disease are felt the most. The months are completely wasted; the nights are agonizing.<br /></span></span>   have been <span class="w H4487" data-lemma="H4487">appointed</span><span class="note"><span class="key">11</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The verb is literally &#8220;they have appointed&#8221;; the form with no expressed subject is to be interpreted as a passive (GKC 460 &#167;144.<i>g</i>). It is therefore not necessary to repoint the verb to make it passive. The word means &#8220;to number; to count,&#8221; and so &#8220;to determine; to allocate.&#8221;<br /></span></span>   to me. </span>
<span class="verse Job_7_4" data-osis="Job.7.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="w H518" data-lemma="H518">If</span> I <span class="w H7901" data-lemma="H7901">lie down</span>,  I <span class="w H559" data-lemma="H559">say</span>,<span class="note"><span class="key">12</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> This is the main clause, and not part of the previous conditional clause; it is introduced by the conjunction <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>) (see GKC 336 &#167;112.<i>gg</i>).<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H4970" data-lemma="H4970">‘When</span> will I <span class="w H6965" data-lemma="H6965">arise</span>?’,  and the <span class="w H6153" data-lemma="H6153">night</span> <span class="w H4059" data-lemma="H4059">stretches</span> on<span class="note"><span class="key">13</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">madad</font>) normally means &#8220;to measure,&#8221; and here in the Piel it has been given the sense of &#8220;to extend.&#8221; But this is not well attested and not widely accepted. There are many conjectural emendations. Of the most plausible one might mention the view of Gray, who changes <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">middad</font>, Piel of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1491;</font>) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1491;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">midde</font>, comprising the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;</font> [<font face="Scholar">min</font>] plus the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1497;</font> [<font face="Scholar">day</font>], meaning &#8220;as often as&#8221;): &#8220;as often as evening comes.&#8221; Dhorme, following the LXX to some extent, adds the word &#8220;day&#8221; after &#8220;when/if&#8221; and replaces <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">middad</font>) with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">matay</font>, &#8220;when&#8221;) to read &#8220;If I lie down, I say, &#8216;When comes the morning?&#8217; If I rise up, I say, &#8216;How long till evening?&#8217;&#8221; The LXX, however, may be based more on a recollection of <ref id="5679">Deut 28:67</ref>. One can make just as strong a case for the reading adopted here, that the night seems to drag on (so also NIV).<br /></span></span>  and I <span class="w H5076 H7646" data-lemma="H5076 H7646">toss and turn restlessly</span><span class="note"><span class="key">14</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1456;&#1491;&#1467;&#1491;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">n&#255;dudim</font>, &#8220;tossing&#8221;) refers to the restless tossing and turning of the sick man at night on his bed. The word is a <i>hapax legomenon</i> derived from the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nadad</font>, &#8220;to flee; to wander; to be restless&#8221;). The plural form here sums up the several parts of the actions (GKC 460 &#167;144.<i>f</i>). E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 99) argues that because it applies to both his waking hours and his sleepless nights, it may have more of the sense of wanderings of the mind. There is no doubt truth to the fact that the mind wanders in all this suffering; but there is no need to go beyond the contextually clear idea of the restlessness of the night.<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H5704" data-lemma="H5704">until</span> the day <span class="w H5399" data-lemma="H5399">dawns</span>.  </span>

Job&#8217;s disease is a malignant ulcer of some kind that causes the rotting of the flesh. One may recall that both Antiochus Epiphanes (2 Macc <ref id="13061">9:9</ref>) and Herod Agrippa (<ref id="27361">Acts 12:23</ref>) were devoured by such worms in their diseases.<br /></span></span>   and <span class="w H1487" data-lemma="H1487">dirty</span> <span class="w H6083" data-lemma="H6083">scabs;</span><span class="note"><span class="key">18</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The text has &#8220;clods of dust.&#8221; The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gish</font>, &#8220;dirty scabs&#8221;) is a <i>hapax legomenon</i> from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gush</font>, &#8220;clod&#8221;). Driver suggests the word has a medical sense, like &#8220;pustules&#8221; (G. R. Driver, &#8220;Problems in the Hebrew text of Job,&#8221; VTSup 3 [1955]: 73) or &#8220;scabs&#8221; (JB, NEB, NAB, NIV). Driver thinks &#8220;clods of dust&#8221; is wrong; he repoints &#8220;dust&#8221; to make a new verb &#8220;to cover,&#8221; cognate to Arabic, and reads &#8220;my flesh is clothed with worms, and scab covers my skin.&#8221; This refers to the dirty scabs that crusted over the sores all over his body. The LXX links this with the second half of the verse: &#8220;And my body has been covered with loathsome worms, and I waste away, scraping off clods of dirt from my eruption.&#8221;<br /></span></span>   my <span class="w H5785" data-lemma="H5785">skin</span> is <span class="w H7280" data-lemma="H7280">broken</span><span class="note"><span class="key">19</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The meaning of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1490;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">raga</font>&#8217;) is also debated here. D. J. A. Clines (<i>Job</i> [WBC], 163) does not think the word can mean &#8220;cracked&#8221; because scabs show evidence of the sores healing. But E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 100) argues that the usage of the word shows the idea of &#8220;splitting, separating, making a break,&#8221; or the like. Here then it would mean &#8220;my skin splits&#8221; and as a result festers. This need not be a reference to the scabs, but to new places. Or it could mean that the scabbing never heals, but is always splitting open.<br /></span></span>   and <span class="w H3988" data-lemma="H3988">festering</span>.  </span>

Hezekiah uses the imagery of the weaver, the loom, and the shuttle for the brevity of life (see <ref id="18403">Isa 38:12</ref>).

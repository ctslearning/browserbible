It was in that same year that he issued the prophecies against the foreign nations recorded in Jer 25 (and probably the prophecies recorded here in Jer 46-51) and that he had Baruch record and read to the people gathered in the temple all the prophecies he had uttered against Judah and Jerusalem up to that point in the hopes that they would repent and the nation would be spared. The fourth year of Jehoiakim (605 <sc>b.c.</sc>) marked a significant shift in the balance of power in Palestine. With the defeat of Necho at Carchemish in that year the area came under the control of Nebuchadnezzar and Judah and the surrounding nations had two options, submit to Babylon and pay tribute or suffer the consequences of death in war or exile in Babylon for failure to submit.<br /></span></span>   over <span class="w H3063" data-lemma="H3063">Judah</span>.<span class="note"><span class="key">4</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Concerning Egypt: Concerning the army of Pharaoh Necho king of Egypt which was beside the Euphrates River at Carchemish which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon defeated in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah.&#8221; The sentence has been broken up, restructured, and introductory words supplied in the translation to make the sentences better conform with contemporary English style. The dating formula is placed in brackets because the passage is prophetic about the battle, but the bracketed words were superscription or introduction and thus were added after the outcome was known.<br /></span></span>   </span>

These were to be arranged in solid ranks to advance into battle. It would be pedantic and misleading to translate here &#8220;Fall into ranks with your large and small shields at the ready&#8221; because that might suggest that soldiers had more than one kind. It is uncertain who is issuing the commands here. TEV adds &#8220;The Egyptian officers shout,&#8221; which is the interpretation of J. A.

It is an adjective used as a noun that can apply to animals, i.e., of a bull (<ref id="14682">Ps 50:13</ref>) or a stallion (<ref id="6646">Judg 5:22</ref>). Moreover, the form is masculine plural and the verbs are singular. Hence, many modern commentaries and English versions follow the redivision of the first line presupposed by the Greek version, &#8220;Apis has fled&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1505; &#1495;&#1463;&#1507;</font>, <font face="Scholar">nas khaf</font>) and see this as a reference to the bull god of Memphis. However, the noun is used of soldiers in <ref id="20326">Lam 1:15</ref> and the plural could be the distributive plural, i.e., each and every one (cf. GKC 464 &#167;145.<i>l</i> and compare usage in <ref id="757">Gen 27:29</ref>).<br /></span></span>   be <span class="w H5502" data-lemma="H5502">defeated</span>?<span class="note"><span class="key">29</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word used here only occurs here (in the Niphal) and in <ref id="17200">Prov 28:3</ref> (in the Qal) where it refers to a rain that beats down grain. That idea would fit nicely with the idea of the soldiers being beaten down, or defeated. It is possible that the rarity of this verb (versus the common verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;</font>, <font face="Scholar">nus</font>, &#8220;flee&#8221;) and the ready identification of Apis with the bull calf (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">abbir</font>) has led to the reading of the Greek text (so C. von Orelli, <i>Jeremiah</i>, 327). The verbs in this verse and the following are in the perfect tense but should be understood as prophetic perfects since the text is dealing with what will happen when Nebuchadnezzar comes into Egypt. The text of <ref id="20054-20070">vv. 18-24</ref> shows a greater mixture with some perfects and some imperfects, sometimes even within the same verse (e.g., <ref id="20068">v. 22</ref>).<br /></span></span>   They will <span class="w H3808" data-lemma="H3808">not</span> <span class="w H5975" data-lemma="H5975">stand</span> <span class="w H3588" data-lemma="H3588">because</span> I, the <span class="w H3068" data-lemma="H3068">Lord</span>,  will <span class="w H1920" data-lemma="H1920">thrust</span><span class="note"><span class="key">30</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the <sc>Lord</sc> will thrust them down.&#8221; However, the <sc>Lord</sc> is speaking (cf. clearly in <ref id="20064">v. 18</ref>), so the first person is adopted for the sake of consistency. This has been a consistent problem in the book of Jeremiah where the prophet is so identified with the word of the <sc>Lord</sc> that he sometimes uses the first person and sometimes the third. It creates confusion for the average reader who is trying to follow the flow of the argument and has been shifted to the first person like this on a number of occasions.

Others see the reference to literal trees and see the decimation of Egypt in general (C. von Orelli, <i>Jeremiah</i>, 329). And some see it as a continuation of the simile of the snake fleeing, the soldiers cutting down the trees because they cannot find it (J. A. Thompson, <i>Jeremiah</i> [NICOT], 693). However, the simile of <ref id="20068">v. 22</ref>a has already been dropped in <ref id="20068">v. 22</ref>b-d; they come against her. Hence it is probably best to see this as a continuation of the simile in <ref id="20068">v. 22</ref>c-d and see the reference to the Babylonian army coming against her, i.e., Egypt (the nation or people of Egypt), like woodcutters cutting down trees.<br /></span></span>   </span>

The first word, used in <ref id="12933">Job 4:2</ref>, refers to Job&#8217;s whole demeanor that he shows his friends &#8211; the impatient and vexed expression of his grief. The second word expresses his misfortune, the cause of his grief. Job wants these placed together in the balances so that his friends could see the misfortune is greater than the grief. The word for &#8220;misfortune&#8221; is a <i>Kethib</i>-<i>Qere</i> reading. The two words have essentially the same meaning; they derive from the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1493;&#1463;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">havah</font>, &#8220;to fall&#8221;) and so mean a misfortune.<br /></span></span>   could be <span class="w H8254" data-lemma="H8254">weighed</span>,<span class="note"><span class="key">4</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The Qal infinitive absolute is here used to intensify the Niphal imperfect (see GKC 344-45 &#167;113.<i>w</i>).

The idea in the context is rather that of speaking wildly, rashly, or charged with grief. This would trace the word to a hollow or geminate word and link it to Arabic &#8220;talk wildly&#8221; (see D. J. A. Clines, <i>Job</i> [WBC], 158). In the older works the verb was taken from a geminate root meaning &#8220;to suck&#8221; or &#8220;to swallow&#8221; (cf.

Many suggestions have been made for changing this word. These seem unnecessary since the MT pointing yields a good meaning: but for the references to these suggestions, see D. J. A. Clines, <i>Job</i> (WBC), 158. H. H. Rowley (<i>Job</i> [NCBC], 59), nonetheless, follows the suggestion of Driver that connects it to a root meaning &#8220;wear me down.&#8221; This change of meaning requires no change in the Hebrew text. The image is of a beleaguering army; the host is made up of all the terrors from God. The reference is to the terrifying and perplexing thoughts that assail Job (A. B. Davidson, <i>Job</i>, 44).<br /></span></span>   against me. </span>

Even though it does not follow quite as well here, it nonetheless makes sense as a strong invective against their lack of sympathy, and the lack of connection could be the result of emotional speech.

But some argue that the word has to be understood in the parallelism to &#8220;wickedness&#8221; of words (D. J. A. Clines, <i>Job</i> [WBC], 162). Gordis connects it to <ref id="22668">Mic 7:3</ref> and <ref id="13984">Ps 5:10</ref> [9] where the meaning &#8220;deceit, falsehood&#8221; is found.

The unit not only serves to record the event in Israel&#8217;s becoming a nation, but it provides a paradigm of the worship of God&#8217;s covenant people &#8211; entering into the presence of the glory of Yahweh. See additionally W. A. Maier, &#8220;The Analysis of Exodus 24 According to Modern Literary, Form, and Redaction Critical Methodology,&#8221; <i>Springfielder</i> 37 (1973): 35-52. The passage may be divided into four parts for exposition: <ref id="2179-2180">vv. 1-2</ref>, the call for worship; <ref id="2181-2186">vv. 3-8</ref>, the consecration of the worshipers; <ref id="2187-2189">vv. 9-11</ref>, the confirmation of the covenant; and <ref id="2180-2196">vv. 12-18</ref>, the communication with Yahweh.<br /></span></span> <span class="w H413" data-lemma="H413">to</span> <span class="w H4872" data-lemma="H4872">Moses</span> the Lord<span class="note"><span class="key">2</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And he;&#8221; the referent (the <sc>Lord</sc>) has been specified in the translation for clarity.<br /></span></span> <span class="w H559" data-lemma="H559">said</span>,  “Come <span class="w H5927" data-lemma="H5927">up</span><span class="note"><span class="key">3</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> They were to come up to the <sc>Lord</sc> after they had made the preparations that are found in <ref id="2181-2186">vv. 3-8</ref>.<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H413" data-lemma="H413">to</span> the <span class="w H3068" data-lemma="H3068">Lord</span>,  <span class="w H859" data-lemma="H859">you</span> and <span class="w H175" data-lemma="H175">Aaron</span>,  <span class="w H5070" data-lemma="H5070">Nadab</span> and <span class="w H30" data-lemma="H30">Abihu</span>,  and <span class="w H7657" data-lemma="H7657">seventy</span> of the <span class="w H2205" data-lemma="H2205">elders</span> of <span class="w H3478" data-lemma="H3478">Israel</span>,  and <span class="w H7812" data-lemma="H7812">worship</span> from a <span class="w H7350" data-lemma="H7350">distance</span>.<span class="note"><span class="key">4</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> These seventy-four people were to go up the mountain to a certain point. Then they were to prostrate themselves and worship Yahweh as Moses went further up into the presence of Yahweh. Moses occupies the lofty position of mediator (as Christ in the NT), for he alone ascends &#8220;to Yahweh&#8221; while everyone waits for his return. The emphasis of &#8220;bowing down&#8221; and that from &#8220;far off&#8221; stresses again the ominous presence that was on the mountain. This was the holy God &#8211; only the designated mediator could draw near to him.<br /></span></span>   </span>

The fact that God did not lay a hand on them &#8211; to kill them &#8211; shows that they saw something that they never expected to see and live. Some Christian interpreters have taken this to refer to a glorious appearance of the preincarnate Christ, the second person of the Trinity. They saw the brilliance of this manifestation &#8211; but not the detail.

From this is derived the epithet &#8220;the Shekinah Glory,&#8221; the dwelling or abiding glory. The &#8220;glory of Yahweh&#8221; was a display visible at a distance, clearly in view of the Israelites. To them it was like a consuming fire in the midst of the cloud that covered the mountain. That fire indicated that Yahweh wished to accept their sacrifice, as if it were a pleasant aroma to him, as Leviticus would say. This &#8220;appearance&#8221; indicated that the phenomena represented a shimmer of the likeness of his glory (B. Jacob, <i>Exodus</i>, 749). The verb, according to U. Cassuto (<i>Exodus</i>, 316), also gives an inkling of the next section of the book, the building of the &#8220;tabernacle,&#8221; the dwelling place, the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mishkan</font>). The vision of the glory of Yahweh confirmed the authority of the revelation of the Law given to Israel. This chapter is the climax of God&#8217;s bringing people into covenant with himself, the completion of his revelation to them, a completion that is authenticated with the miraculous. It ends with the mediator going up in the clouds to be with God, and the people down below eagerly awaiting his return. The message of the whole chapter could be worded this way: Those whom God sanctifies by the blood of the covenant and instructs by the book of the covenant may enjoy fellowship with him and anticipate a far more glorious fellowship. So too in the NT the commandments and teachings of Jesus are confirmed by his miraculous deeds and by his glorious manifestation on the Mount of the Transfiguration, where a few who represented the disciples would see his glory and be able to teach others. The people of the new covenant have been brought into fellowship with God through the blood of the covenant; they wait eagerly for his return from heaven in the clouds.<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H5921" data-lemma="H5921">on</span> <span class="w H2022" data-lemma="H2022">Mount</span> <span class="w H5514" data-lemma="H5514">Sinai</span>,  and the <span class="w H6051" data-lemma="H6051">cloud</span> <span class="w H3680" data-lemma="H3680">covered</span> it for <span class="w H8337" data-lemma="H8337">six</span> <span class="w H3117" data-lemma="H3117">days</span>.<span class="note"><span class="key">42</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> This is an adverbial accusative of time.<br /></span></span>   On the <span class="w H7637" data-lemma="H7637">seventh</span> <span class="w H3117" data-lemma="H3117">day</span> he <span class="w H7121" data-lemma="H7121">called</span> <span class="w H413" data-lemma="H413">to</span> <span class="w H4872" data-lemma="H4872">Moses</span> from <span class="w H8432" data-lemma="H8432">within</span> the <span class="w H6051" data-lemma="H6051">cloud</span>.  </span>

But he clearly was brought into God&#8217;s presence; he was like a heavenly servant before God&#8217;s throne, like the angels, and he consumed neither bread nor water. The purpose of his being there was to become familiar with all God&#8217;s demands and purposes. He would receive the tablets of stone and all the instructions for the tabernacle that was to be built (beginning in chap. 25).

<h3>Jeremiah Counsels Submission to Babylon</h3>
<p>
<span class="verse Jer_27_1" data-osis="Jer.27.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>The <span class="w H3069" data-lemma="H3069">Lord</span> <span class="w H559" data-lemma="H559">spoke</span> to <span class="w H3414" data-lemma="H3414">Jeremiah</span><span class="note"><span class="key">1</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> The names of Jeremiah and of Nebuchadnezzar are spelled differently in the Hebrew of chapter 27-29. That and other literary features show that these three chapters are all closely related. The events of these three chapters all take place within the space of one year (cf. <ref id="19620, 19653">28:1; 29:17</ref>).<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H7225" data-lemma="H7225">early</span> in the <span class="w H4467" data-lemma="H4467">reign</span> of <span class="w H2977" data-lemma="H2977">Josiah’s</span>  <span class="w H1121" data-lemma="H1121">son</span>,  <span class="w H4428" data-lemma="H4428">King</span> <span class="t1">Zedekiah</span> of <span class="w H3063" data-lemma="H3063">Judah</span>.<span class="note"><span class="key">2</span><span class="text"><b>tc</b> The reading here is based on a few Hebrew <sc>mss</sc> and the Syriac and Arabic versions. The majority of Hebrew <sc>mss</sc> and most of the versions read &#8220;At the beginning of the reign of Josiah&#8217;s son, Jehoiakim king of Judah&#8221; as in <ref id="19574">26:1</ref>. The LXX does not have this whole verse. It has long been recognized that the text of <ref id="19598">27:1</ref> is textually corrupt. The date formula in the majority of Hebrew <sc>mss</sc> at <ref id="19598">27:1</ref> is contradictory both with the context of the passage which deals with an event in the reign of Zedekiah (see <ref id="19600">vv. 3</ref>, 13 and <ref id="19617">v. 20</ref> which presupposes that Jeconiah, Jehoiakim&#8217;s son, has been taken captive [i.e., after the death of Jehoiakim!]) and the date formula in <ref id="19620">28:1</ref> which refers to an event &#8220;in that same year&#8221; and then qualifies it with &#8220;Early in the reign of Zedekiah.&#8221; Hence it is preferable to read &#8220;Zedekiah&#8221; here in place of &#8220;Jehoiakim&#8221; and explain the error in the Hebrew manuscripts as an erroneous copying of <ref id="19574">26:1</ref>.<br /><br/></br><b>sn</b> If the text of <ref id="19620">28:1</ref> is correct, the date here would be sometime in the fourth year of Zedekiah which would be 594/3 <sc>b.c</sc>. Zedekiah had been placed on the throne as a puppet king by Nebuchadnezzar after he deposed Zedekiah&#8217;s nephew, Jeconiah (Jehoiachin) and sent him, his family, some of the temple treasures, and some of the Judean leaders away to Babylon (<ref id="10174-10183">2 Kgs 23:8-17</ref>). The author does not state directly why the envoys from the nations mentioned in <ref id="19600">v. 3</ref> were in Jerusalem, but the implication is that they were there trying to interest Zedekiah in rebelling. Modern scholars have used the data here and in <ref id="19620">28:1</ref> and in the Babylonian Chronicles (it contains a record of major events of Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s reign) to suggest a plausible background for such a meeting. Nebuchadnezzar had to put down an uprising in the east and quell a rebellion in Babylon itself in the two years prior to this meeting. Some &#8220;prophets&#8221; in the nation of Israel and in these other nations (see <ref id="19606-19607">vv. 9-10</ref>) saw in these events hopes for not having to pay tribute to (i.e., submit to the yoke of) Nebuchadnezzar and were counseling rebellion. Jeremiah saw this as foolhardy and counseled otherwise. Again, there is a conflict between &#8220;prophets&#8221; which is what this whole section (Jer 27&#8211;29) is all about.<br /></span></span>   </span>
<span class="verse Jer_27_2" data-osis="Jer.27.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>The <span class="w H3068" data-lemma="H3068">Lord</span>  <span class="w H559" data-lemma="H559">told</span> me,<span class="note"><span class="key">3</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> There is some disjunction in the narrative of this chapter. The introduction in <ref id="19598">v. 1</ref> presents this as a third person narrative. But the rest of the passage reports the narrative in first person. Thus the text reads here &#8220;Thus the <sc>Lord</sc> said to me&#8230;&#8221; In <ref id="19609">vv. 12</ref>, 16 the narrative picks up in first person report and never indicates that Jeremiah carried out the command in <ref id="19599-19601">vv. 2-4</ref> that introduces the message which he repeats in summary form himself to Zedekiah. The report is thus an &#8220;unedited&#8221; first person report. This may create some confusion for some readers, but it is best to leave it in first person here because of the continuation in <ref id="19609">vv. 12</ref>, 16.<br /></span></span> <span class="w H6213" data-lemma="H6213">“Make</span> a <span class="w H4147" data-lemma="H4147">yoke</span><span class="note"><span class="key">4</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> The <i>yoke</i> is a common biblical symbol of political servitude (see, e.g., <ref id="5660">Deut 28:48</ref>; <ref id="9156, 9161, 9162">1 Kgs 12:4, 9, 10</ref>). From the context of 1 Kgs 12 it is clear that it applied to taxation and the provision of conscript labor. In international political contexts it involved the payment of heavy tribute which was often conscripted from the citizens (see, e.g., <ref id="9945-9946, 10200-10201">2 Kgs 15:19-20; 23:34-35</ref>) and the furnishing of military contingents for the sovereign&#8217;s armies (see, e.g., <ref id="10205">2 Kgs 24:2</ref>). Jeremiah&#8217;s message here combines both a symbolic action (the wearing of a yoke) and words of explanation as in <ref id="19409-19421">Jer 19:1-13</ref>. (See <ref id="18031-18036">Isa 20:1-6</ref> for an example outside of Jeremiah.) The casting off of the yoke has been used earlier in <ref id="18986, 19064">Jer 2:20; 5:5</ref> to refer to Israel&#8217;s failure to remain spiritually &#8220;subject&#8221; or faithful to God.<br /></span></span>   out of leather straps and <span class="w H4133" data-lemma="H4133">wooden crossbars</span> and <span class="w H5414" data-lemma="H5414">put</span> it <span class="w H5921" data-lemma="H5921">on</span> your <span class="w H6677" data-lemma="H6677">neck</span>.  </span>

The Greek translation supports reading the verb &#8220;destroy&#8221; but treats it as though it were intransitive &#8220;until they are destroyed by his hand&#8221; (reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1467;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1501;</font> [<font face="Scholar">tummam</font>]). The MT here is accepted as the more difficult reading and support is seen in the transitive use of the verb in <ref id="14858">Ps 64:7</ref>.<br /><br/></br><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will punish that nation until I have destroyed them [i.e., its people] by his hand.&#8221; &#8220;Hand&#8221; here refers to agency.

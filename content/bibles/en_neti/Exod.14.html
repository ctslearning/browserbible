Nor is the purport of the protest of the Israelite foremen (v 21 [<ref id="1654">5:21</ref>]) identical with that of the words uttered now. However, from a psychological standpoint the matter can be easily explained. In the hour of peril the children of Israel remember that remonstrance, and now it seems to them that it was of a sharper character and flowed from their foresight, and that the present situation justifies it, for death awaits them at this moment in the desert.&#8221; This declaration that &#8220;we told you so,&#8221; born of fright, need not have been strictly accurate or logical.<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H3588" data-lemma="H3588">because</span> it is <span class="w H2896" data-lemma="H2896">better</span> for us to <span class="w H5647" data-lemma="H5647">serve</span><span class="note"><span class="key">33</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;better for us to serve.&#8221;<br /></span></span>   the <span class="w H4713" data-lemma="H4713">Egyptians</span> than to <span class="w H4191" data-lemma="H4191">die</span> in the <span class="w H4057" data-lemma="H4057">desert!’”</span><span class="note"><span class="key">34</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> Since Hebrew does not use quotation marks to indicate the boundaries of quotations, there is uncertainty about whether the Israelites&#8217; statement in Egypt includes the end of <ref id="1902">v. 12</ref> or consists solely of &#8220;leave us alone so that we can serve the Egyptians.&#8221; In either case, the command to Moses to leave them alone rested on the assumption, spoken or unspoken, that serving Egypt would be less risky than what Moses was proposing.

R. Driver says that the belief intended here is not simply a crediting of a testimony concerning a person or a thing, but a laying firm hold morally on a person or a thing (<i>Exodus</i>, 122). Others take the Hiphil sense to be declarative, and that would indicate a considering of the object of faith trustworthy or dependable, and therefore to be acted on. In this passage it does not mean that here they came to faith, but that they became convinced that he would save them in the future.<br /></span></span>  the <span class="w H3068" data-lemma="H3068">Lord</span> and in his <span class="w H5650" data-lemma="H5650">servant</span> <span class="w H4872" data-lemma="H4872">Moses</span>.<span class="note"><span class="key">82</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> Here the title of &#8220;servant&#8221; is given to Moses. This is the highest title a mortal can have in the OT &#8211; the &#8220;servant of Yahweh.&#8221; It signifies more than a believer; it describes the individual as acting on behalf of God. For example, when Moses stretched out his hand, God used it as his own (<ref id="18879">Isa 63:12</ref>). Moses was God&#8217;s personal representative. The chapter records both a message of salvation and of judgment. Like the earlier account of deliverance at the Passover, this chapter can be a lesson on deliverance from present troubles &#8211; if God could do this for Israel, there is no trouble too great for him to overcome. The passage can also be understood as a picture (at least) of the deliverance at the final judgment on the world. But the Israelites used this account for a paradigm of the power of God: namely, God is able to deliver his people from danger because he is the sovereign Lord of creation. His people must learn to trust him, even in desperate situations; they must fear him and not the situation. God can bring any threat to an end by bringing his power to bear in judgment on the wicked.<br /></span></span>    </span>

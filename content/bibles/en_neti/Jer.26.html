<h3>Jeremiah Is Put on Trial as a False Prophet </h3>

In this case it would refer to the part of the year between September, 609 <sc>b.c.</sc> when Jehoiakim was placed on the throne as a puppet king by Pharaoh Necho (<ref id="10200-10201">2 Kgs 23:34-35</ref>) and April, 608 <sc>b.c.</sc> when he would have been officially celebrated as king. However, it will be suggested below in conjunction with the textual problems in <ref id="19598">27:1</ref> and <ref id="99999">28:1</ref> that the term does not necessarily refer to this period.<br /></span></span>   of <span class="w H2977" data-lemma="H2977">Josiah’s</span> <span class="w H1121" data-lemma="H1121">son</span>,  <span class="w H4428" data-lemma="H4428">King</span> <span class="w H3079" data-lemma="H3079">Jehoiakim</span> of <span class="w H3063" data-lemma="H3063">Judah</span>.  </span>

In ch. 9 he argues that God&#8217;s power and majesty prevent him from establishing his integrity in his complaint to God. And in ch. 10 Job tries to discover in God&#8217;s plan the secret of his afflictions. The speech seems to continue what Job was saying to Eliphaz more than it addresses Bildad. See K.

On the other hand, if the interpretation were that God does not answer the demands of mortals, then a simple progressive imperfect would be required. In support of this is the frustration of Job that God does not answer him.<br /></span></span>   and <span class="w H533" data-lemma="H533">mighty</span><span class="note"><span class="key">10</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The genitive phrase translated &#8220;in heart&#8221; would be a genitive of specification, specifying that the wisdom of God is in his intelligent decisions.<br /><br/></br><b>sn</b> The <i>heart</i> is the seat of intelligence and understanding, the faculty of decision making.<br /></span></span>   in <span class="w H3581" data-lemma="H3581">strength</span>–<span class="note"><span class="key">11</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> The words <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1509;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ammits</font>) and <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">koakh</font>) are synonyms, the first meaning &#8220;sturdy; mighty; robust,&#8221; and the second &#8220;strength.&#8221; It too can be interpreted as a genitive of specification &#8211; God is mighty with respect to his power. But that comes close to expressing a superlative idea (like &#8220;song of songs&#8221; or &#8220;anger of his wrath&#8221;).<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H4310" data-lemma="H4310">who</span> has <span class="w H7185" data-lemma="H7185">resisted</span><span class="note"><span class="key">12</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The first half of the verse simply has &#8220;wise of heart and mighty of strength.&#8221; The entire line is a <i>casus pendens</i> that will refer to the suffix on <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1464;&#1497;&#1493;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elayv</font>) in the second colon.

It frequently is found with the word for &#8220;neck,&#8221; describing people as &#8220;stiff-necked,&#8221; i.e., stubborn, unbending. So the idea of resisting God fits well. The fact that this word occurs in Exodus with the idea of hardening the heart against God may indicate that there is an allusion to Pharaoh here.<br /></span></span>   </span>

Some follow the Syriac with a singular verb, i.e., God does not know it, meaning, it is so trifling to God that he can do it without thinking. But the better interpretation may be &#8220;suddenly.&#8221; This would be interpreted from the MT as it stands; it would imply &#8220;before they know anything,&#8221; thus &#8220;suddenly&#8221; (Gray, Dhorme, Buttenwieser, et. al.). D. W. Thomas connects the meaning to another verb based on Arabic and translates it, &#8220; so that they are no longer still&#8221; (&#8220;Additional Notes on the Root <i>yada`</i> in Hebrew,&#8221; <i>JTS</i> 15 [1964]: 54-57).

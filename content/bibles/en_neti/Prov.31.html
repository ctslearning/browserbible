The passage is the only direct address to a king in the book of Proverbs &#8211; something that was the norm in wisdom literature of the ancient world (Leah L. Brunner, &#8220;King and Commoner in Proverbs and Near Eastern Sources,&#8221; <i>Dor le Dor</i> 10 [1982]: 210-19; Brunner argues that the advice is religious and not secular).<br /></span></span>   an <span class="w H4853" data-lemma="H4853">oracle</span><span class="note"><span class="key">2</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> Some English versions take the Hebrew noun translated &#8220;oracle&#8221; here as a place name specifying the kingdom of King Lemuel; cf.

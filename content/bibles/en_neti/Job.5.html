Many commentators either delete the line altogether or try to repoint it to make more sense out of it. G. R. Driver had taken the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el</font>, &#8220;towards&#8221;) as the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el</font>, &#8220;strong man&#8221;) and the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsinnim</font>, &#8220;thorns&#8221;) connected to Aramaic <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsinnah</font>, &#8220;basket&#8221;); he read it as &#8220;a strong man snatches it from the baskets&#8221; (G. R. Driver, &#8220;on <ref id="12957">Job 5:5</ref>,&#8221; <i>TZ</i> 12 [1956]: 485-86). E.

Instead of &#8220;thorns&#8221; the LXX has the idea of &#8220;trouble.&#8221; The Targum to Job interprets it with &#8220;shield&#8221; and adds &#8220;warriors&#8221; as the subject.<br /></span></span>   </span>

Sparks, he argues, do not soar high above the earth. Other suggestions include Resheph, the Phoenician god of lightning (Pope), the fire of passion (Buttenwieser), angels (Peake), or demons (Targum Job). None of these are convincing; the idea of sparks flying upward fits the translation well and makes clear sense in the passage.<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H5774" data-lemma="H5774">fly</span><span class="note"><span class="key">25</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The simple translation of the last two words is &#8220;fly high&#8221; or &#8220;soar aloft&#8221; which would suit the idea of an eagle.

The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yakhakh</font>) is a legal term; it always has some sense of a charge, dispute, or conflict. Its usages show that it may describe a strife breaking out, a charge or quarrel in progress, or the settling of a dispute (<ref id="17673">Isa 1:18</ref>). The derived noun can mean &#8220;reproach; recrimination; charge&#8221; (<ref id="13160, 13424">13:6; 23:4</ref>). Here the emphasis is on the consequence of the charge brought, namely, the correction.<br /></span></span>   so do <span class="w H408" data-lemma="H408">not</span> <span class="w H3988" data-lemma="H3988">despise</span> the <span class="w H4148" data-lemma="H4148">discipline</span><span class="note"><span class="key">66</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">musar</font>) is parallel to the idea of the first colon.

This characterization is important because Zedekiah is portrayed in the incidents that follow in 37&#8211;38 as seeking the <sc>Lord</sc>&#8217;s help or seeking a word from the <sc>Lord</sc>. However though he did send to inquire of Jeremiah three times, he did not pay attention to the warnings that he received in reply and was ultimately responsible for the fall of Jerusalem (Jer 39). As elsewhere in the book of Jeremiah, Jeconiah&#8217;s reign is passed over in silence because it was negligible and because Jeremiah did not wish to legitimize the hopes that many in Israel and Babylon had in his returning from exile and resuming rule over Judah (see further the study notes on <ref id="19479, 19485">22:24, 30</ref> and <ref id="99999">33:30</ref>).<br /></span></span>   </span>

<h3>The Lord Responds to Zedekiah's Hope for Help</h3>
<p>

Both of them are against the background of the siege of Jerusalem which was instigated by Zedekiah&#8217;s rebelling against Nebuchadnezzar and sending to Egypt for help (cf. <ref id="20841">Ezek 17:15</ref>). The earlier delegation (<ref id="19442-19443">21:1-2</ref>) was sent before Nebuchadnezzar had clamped down on Jerusalem because the Judean forces at that time were still fighting against the Babylonian forces in the open field (see <ref id="19445">21:4</ref> and the translator&#8217;s note there). Here the siege has been lifted because the Babylonian troops had heard a report that the Egyptian army was on the way into Palestine to give the Judeans the promised aid (<ref id="19880">vv. 5</ref>, 7). The request is briefer here than in <ref id="19443">21:2</ref> but the intent is no doubt the same (see also the study note on <ref id="19443">21:2</ref>).<br /></span></span>    <span class="w H3081" data-lemma="H3081">Jehucal</span><span class="note"><span class="key">5</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> <i>Jehucal</i> was one of the officials who later sought to have Jeremiah put to death for what they considered treason (<ref id="19897-19900">38:1-4</ref>).<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H1121" data-lemma="H1121">son</span> of <span class="w H8018" data-lemma="H8018">Shelemiah</span> and the <span class="w H3548" data-lemma="H3548">priest</span>  <span class="w H6846" data-lemma="H6846">Zephaniah</span><span class="note"><span class="key">6</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> <i>The priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah</i> was a member of the earlier delegation (<ref id="19443">21:2</ref>) and the chief of security in the temple to whom the Babylonian false prophet wrote a letter complaining that Jeremiah should be locked up for his treasonous prophecies (<ref id="19661-19662">29:25-26</ref>).

It is supplied in the translation here to better show that the information in <ref id="19879-19880">vv. 4-5</ref> is all parenthetical, providing a background for the oracle that will follow. For the meaning &#8220;given up their siege against&#8221; (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;had taken themselves away from against&#8221;) see BDB 749 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> Niph.1.c(2); 759 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</font> IV.2.b.<br /><br/></br><b>sn</b> The Pharaoh referred to here is Pharaoh Hophra who is named in <ref id="20041">Jer 44:30</ref>. He ruled from 589-570 <sc>b.c</sc>. Shortly after he began to rule, Zedekiah had been enticed by some of the officials in his court to appeal to him for aid. This act of rebellion quickly brought Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s wrath and he invaded Judah, blockading Jerusalem and reducing the fortified cities of Judah one by one. According to <ref id="19925">Jer 39:1</ref> the siege began in Zedekiah&#8217;s ninth year (589/88 <sc>b.c.</sc>) and lasted until his eleventh year when Jerusalem fell (587/86 <sc>b.c.</sc>). The army of Pharaoh likely came sometime during 588 <sc>b.c</sc>.<br /></span></span>    </span>

The latter nuance appears appropriate in <ref id="19425">Jer 20:2</ref> where Zedekiah is hoping for some miraculous intervention. That nuance also appears appropriate here where Zedekiah has sent messengers to ask Jeremiah to intercede on their behalf.

The Hebrew expression here occurs nowhere else in the Hebrew Bible and its meaning is debated. The verb is pointed as a shortened form of the Hiphil infinitive construct of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khalaq</font>; see GKC 148 &#167;53.<i>q</i> for explanation of the phenomenon and other examples). There are, however, no other examples of the use of this verb in the Hiphil. BDB 324 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1511;</font> Hiph defines it as &#8220;receive a portion&#8221; and explains it as a denominative from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1461;&#1500;&#1462;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kheleq</font>, &#8220;portion&#8221;) but says that the form is dubious. KBL s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1511;</font> Hif defines it as &#8220;take part in dividing&#8221; but that does not fit the prepositional phrase that follows (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1464;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">misham</font>, &#8220;from there&#8221;) as well as &#8220;to receive a portion.&#8221; The Greek version did not understand this of dividing property but of conducting business. Later revisions of the Greek and the Latin version, however, did understand it of &#8220;taking a share.&#8221; The translation of BDB has been expanded to better reflect the probable situation. For the meaning of &#8220;his family&#8221; for the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">am</font>) compare the usage in <ref id="13296">Job 18:19</ref>.

Others have changed both the noun and the verb to obtain something like &#8220;My eye is weary of their contentiousness&#8221; (Holscher), or mine eyes are wearied by your stream of peevish complaints&#8221; (G. R. Driver, &#8220;Problems in the Hebrew text of Job,&#8221; VTSup 3 [1955]: 78). There is no alternative suggestion that is compelling.<br /></span></span> </span>

B. Davidson (<i>Job</i>, 126) suggests that the first verb means &#8220;give a pledge,&#8221; and so the two similar verbs would be emphatic: &#8220;Give a pledge, be my surety.&#8221; Other than such a change (which would involve changing the vowels) one would have to interpret similarly by seeing the imperatives as a kind of hendiadys, with the main emphasis being on the second imperative, &#8220;make a pledge.&#8221;<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H5973" data-lemma="H5973">with</span> you. <span class="w H4310" data-lemma="H4310">Who</span> else will <span class="w H8628 H3027" data-lemma="H8628 H3027">put up security</span> for me?<span class="note"><span class="key">8</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> The idiom is &#8220;to strike the hand.&#8221; Here the wording is a little different, &#8220;Who is he that will strike himself into my hand?&#8221;<br /></span></span> </span>

<span class="verse Job_17_5" data-osis="Job.17.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>If a man <span class="w H5046" data-lemma="H5046">denounces</span> his <span class="w H7453" data-lemma="H7453">friends</span> for <span class="w H2506" data-lemma="H2506">personal gain</span>,<span class="note"><span class="key">12</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;for a portion.&#8221; This verse is rather obscure. The words are not that difficult, but the sense of them in this context is. Some take the idea to mean &#8220;he denounces his friends for a portion,&#8221; and others have a totally different idea of &#8220;he invites his friends to share with him.&#8221; The former fits the context better, indicating that Job&#8217;s friends speak out against him for some personal gain. The second half of the verse then promises that his children will suffer loss for this attempt at gain. The line is surely proverbial. A number of other interpretations can be found in the commentaries.<br /></span></span>   the <span class="w H5869" data-lemma="H5869">eyes</span> of his <span class="w H1121" data-lemma="H1121">children</span> will <span class="w H3615" data-lemma="H3615">fail</span>.  </span>

The LXX has &#8220;you have made me.&#8221; So most commentators clarify the verb in some such way.

The expression is &#8220;and a spitting in/to the face I have become,&#8221; i.e., &#8220;I have become one in whose face people spit.&#8221; Various suggestions have been made, including a link to Tophet, but they are weak. The verse as it exists in the MT is fine, and fits the context well.<br /></span></span>    </span>

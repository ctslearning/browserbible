<h3>The First Blow: Water to Blood</h3>

Until now the dominant focus has been on preparing the deliverer for the exodus. From here the account will focus on preparing Pharaoh for it. The theological emphasis for exposition of the entire series of plagues may be: The sovereign Lord is fully able to deliver his people from the oppression of the world so that they may worship and serve him alone. The distinct idea of each plague then will contribute to this main idea. It is clear from the outset that God could have delivered his people simply and suddenly. But he chose to draw out the process with the series of plagues. There appear to be several reasons: First, the plagues are designed to judge Egypt. It is justice for slavery. Second, the plagues are designed to inform Israel and Egypt of the ability of Yahweh. Everyone must know that it is Yahweh doing all these things. The Egyptians must know this before they are destroyed. Third, the plagues are designed to deliver Israel. The first plague is the plague of blood: God has absolute power over the sources of life. Here Yahweh strikes the heart of Egyptian life with death and corruption. The lesson is that God can turn the source of life into the prospect of death. Moreover, the Nile was venerated; so by turning it into death Moses was showing the superiority of Yahweh.<br /></span></span> <span class="w H3068" data-lemma="H3068">Lord</span> <span class="w H559" data-lemma="H559">said</span> <span class="w H413" data-lemma="H413">to</span> <span class="w H4872" data-lemma="H4872">Moses</span>,  <span class="w H6547" data-lemma="H6547">“Pharaoh’s</span>  <span class="w H3820" data-lemma="H3820">heart</span> is hard;<span class="note"><span class="key">27</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;unresponsive&#8221; (so <i>HALOT</i> 456 s.v.

C. Kaiser summarizes a view that has been adopted by many scholars, including a good number of conservatives, that the plagues overlap with natural phenomena in Egypt. Accordingly, the &#8220;blood&#8221; would not be literal blood, but a reddish contamination in the water. If there was an unusually high inundation of the Nile, the water flowed sluggishly through swamps and was joined with the water from the mountains that washed out the reddish soil. If the flood were high, the water would have a deeper red color. In addition to this discoloration, there is said to be a type of algae which produce a stench and a deadly fluctuation of the oxygen level of the river that is fatal to fish (see W. C. Kaiser, Jr., &#8220;Exodus,&#8221; <i>EBC</i> <ref id="99999">2:350</ref>; he cites Greta Hort, &#8220;The Plagues of Egypt,&#8221; <i>ZAW</i> 69 [1957]: 84-103; same title, <i>ZAW</i> 70 [1958]: 48-59). While most scholars would agree that the water did not actually become blood (any more than the moon will be turned to literal blood [<ref id="22343">Joel 2:31</ref>]), many are not satisfied with this kind of explanation. If the event was a fairly common feature of the Nile, it would not have been any kind of sign to Pharaoh &#8211; and it should still be observable. The features that would have to be safeguarded are that it was understood to be done by the staff of God, that it was unexpected and not a mere coincidence, and that the magnitude of the contamination, color, stench, and death, was unparalleled. God does use natural features in miracles, but to be miraculous signs they cannot simply coincide with natural phenomena.<br /></span></span>   </span>

One possible suggestion is that the plague turned the Nile into &#8220;blood,&#8221; but that it gradually turned back to its normal color and substance. However, the effects of the &#8220;blood&#8221; polluted the water so that dead fish and other contamination left it undrinkable. This would explain how the magicians could also do it &#8211; they would not have tried if all water was already turned to blood. It also explains why Pharaoh did not ask for the water to be turned back. This view was put forward by B. Schor; it is summarized by B. Jacob (<i>Exodus</i>, 258), who prefers the view of Rashi that the blow affected only water in use.<br /></span></span>   </span>

<h3>The Second Blow: Frogs</h3>

Since they had already been exposed to the poisonous water, they died very suddenly. The miracle was in the announcement and the timing, i.e., that Moses would predict this blow, and in the magnitude of it all, which was not natural (Greta Hort, &#8220;The Plagues of Egypt,&#8221; <i>ZAW</i> 69 [1957]: 95-98). It is also important to note that in parts of Egypt there was a fear of these creatures as embodying spirits capable of great evil. People developed the mentality of bowing to incredibly horrible idols to drive away the bad spirits. Evil spirits are represented in the book of Revelation in the forms of frogs (<ref id="30968">Rev 16:13</ref>). The frogs that the magicians produced could very well have been in the realm of evil spirits. Exactly how the Egyptians thought about this plague is hard to determine, but there is enough evidence to say that the plague would have made them spiritually as well as physically uncomfortable, and that the death of the frogs would have been a &#8220;sign&#8221; from God about their superstitions and related beliefs. The frog is associated with the god Hapi, and a frog-headed goddess named Heqet was supposed to assist women at childbirth. The plague would have been evidence that Yahweh was controlling their environment and upsetting their beliefs for his own purpose.<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H4390" data-lemma="H4390">full</span> <span class="w H3117" data-lemma="H3117">days</span> passed<span class="note"><span class="key">62</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The text literally has &#8220;and seven days were filled.&#8221; Seven days gave Pharaoh enough time to repent and release Israel.

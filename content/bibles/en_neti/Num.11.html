<h3>The Israelites Complain</h3>
<p>
<span class="verse Num_11_1" data-osis="Num.11.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="w H1961" data-lemma="H1961">When</span><span class="note"><span class="key">1</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> The chapter includes the initial general complaints (<ref id="4026-4028">vv. 1-3</ref>), the complaints about food (<ref id="4029-4034">vv. 4-9</ref>), Moses&#8217; own complaint to the <sc>Lord</sc> (<ref id="99999-4040">vv. 10-15</ref>), God&#8217;s response to Moses (<ref id="4031-4050">vv. 16-25</ref>), Eldad and Medad (<ref id="4031-4054">vv. 26-29</ref>), and the quail (<ref id="99999-4060">vv. 30-35</ref>). The first part records the burning of the camp, named Taberah. Here is one of the several naming narratives in the wilderness experience. The occasion for divine judgment is the complaining of the people. The passages serve to warn believers of all ages not to murmur as the Israelites did, for such complaining reveals a lack of faith in the power and goodness of God. For additional literature, see W. Brueggemann, &#8220;From Hurt to Joy, from Death to Life,&#8221; <i>Int</i> 28 (1974): 3-19; B. S. Childs, &#8220;The Etiological Tale Re-examined,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 24 (1974): 387-97; G. W.

It is a rare word, occurring in <ref id="20394">Lam 3:39</ref>. With this blunt introduction the constant emphasis of obedience to the word of the <sc>Lord</sc> found throughout the first ten chapters suddenly comes to an end. It is probable that the people were tired of moving for several days, the excitement of the new beginning died out quickly in the &#8220;great and terrible wilderness.&#8221; Resentment, frustration, discomfort &#8211; whatever it all involved &#8211; led to complaining and not gratitude.<br /></span></span>   it <span class="w H241 H7451" data-lemma="H241 H7451">displeased</span><span class="note"><span class="key">3</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;it was evil in the ears of the <sc>Lord</sc>.&#8221; The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ra</font>&#8217;) is a much stronger word than &#8220;displeased&#8221; would suggest.

The other significant place where this &#8220;fire of the <sc>Lord</sc>&#8221; destroyed was in the case of Nadab and Abihu who brought strange fire to the altar (<ref id="2980">Lev 10:2</ref>).<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H1197" data-lemma="H1197">burned</span> among them and <span class="w H398" data-lemma="H398">consumed</span> some of the <span class="w H7097" data-lemma="H7097">outer parts</span> of the <span class="w H4264" data-lemma="H4264">camp</span>.  </span>

The NT will say that in times of suffering Christians do not know how to pray, but the Spirit intercedes for them, changing their cries into the proper prayers (Rom 8).<br /></span></span>   </span>

It is explained by the formula using the same verbal root, &#8220;to burn.&#8221; Such naming narratives are found dozens of times in the OT, and most frequently in the Pentateuch. The explanation is seldom an exact etymology, and so in the literature is called a popular etymology. It is best to explain the connection as a figure of speech, a paronomasia, which is a phonetic wordplay that may or may not be etymologically connected. Usually the name is connected to the explanation by a play on the verbal root &#8211; here the preterite explaining the noun. The significance of commemorating the place by such a device is to &#8220;burn&#8221; it into the memory of Israel. The narrative itself would be remembered more easily by the name and its motif. The namings in the wilderness wanderings remind the faithful of unbelief, and warn us all not to murmur as they murmured. See further A. P. Ross, &#8220;Paronomasia and Popular Etymologies in the Naming Narrative of the Old Testament,&#8221; Ph.D. diss., University of Cambridge, 1982.<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H3588" data-lemma="H3588">because</span> there the <span class="w H784" data-lemma="H784">fire</span> of the <span class="w H3068" data-lemma="H3068">Lord</span> <span class="w H1197" data-lemma="H1197">burned</span> among them. </span>

<h3>Complaints about Food</h3>
<p>
<span class="verse Num_11_4" data-osis="Num.11.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Now<span class="note"><span class="key">11</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> The story of the sending of the quail is a good example of poetic justice, or talionic justice. God had provided for the people, but even in that provision they were not satisfied, for they remembered other foods they had in Egypt. No doubt there was not the variety of foods in the Sinai that might have been available in Egypt, but their life had been bitter bondage there as well. They had cried to the <sc>Lord</sc> for salvation, but now they forget, as they remember things they used to have. God will give them what they crave, but it will not do for them what they desire. For more information on this story, see B. J. Malina, <i>The Palestinian Manna Tradition</i>. For the attempt to explain manna and the other foods by natural phenomena, see F. W. Bodenheimer, &#8220;The Manna of Sinai,&#8221; <i>BA</i> 10 (1947): 1-6.<br /></span></span>  the <span class="w H628" data-lemma="H628">mixed multitude</span><span class="note"><span class="key">12</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The mixed multitude (or &#8220;rabble,&#8221; so NASB, NIV, NRSV; NLT &#8220;foreign rabble&#8221;) is the translation of an unusual word, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1458;&#1464;&#1488;&#1505;&#1463;&#1508;&#1456;&#1505;&#1467;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">safsuf</font>). It occurs in the Hebrew Bible only here. It may mean &#8220;a gathering of people&#8221; from the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1505;&#1463;&#1507;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">asaf</font>), yielding the idea of a mixed multitude (in line with <ref id="1855">Exod 12:38</ref>). But the root is different, and so no clear connection can be established. Many commentators therefore think the word is stronger, showing contempt through a word that would be equivalent to &#8220;riff-raff.&#8221;<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H834" data-lemma="H834">who</span> were <span class="w H7130" data-lemma="H7130">among</span> them <span class="w H183" data-lemma="H183">craved</span> more <span class="w H8378" data-lemma="H8378">desirable</span> foods,<span class="note"><span class="key">13</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The Hebrew simply uses the cognate accusative, saying &#8220;they craved a craving&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1493;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; &#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">hit</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">avvu ta</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">vah</font>), but the context shows that they had this strong craving for food. The verb describes a strong desire, which is not always negative (<ref id="16165-16166">Ps 132:13-14</ref>). But the word is a significant one in the Torah; it was used in the garden story for Eve&#8217;s desire for the tree, and it is used in the Decalogue in the warning against coveting (<ref id="5075">Deut 5:21</ref>).<br /></span></span> <span class="w H1571" data-lemma="H1571">and</span> so the <span class="w H3478 H1121" data-lemma="H3478 H1121">Israelites</span> <span class="w H1058" data-lemma="H1058">wept</span> <span class="w H7725" data-lemma="H7725">again</span><span class="note"><span class="key">14</span><span class="text"><b>tc</b> The Greek and the Latin versions read &#8220;and they sat down&#8221; for &#8220;and they returned,&#8221; involving just a change in vocalization (which they did not have).

But the change does not improve this verse.<br /><br/></br><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text uses a verbal hendiadys here, one word serving as an adverb for the other. It literally reads &#8220;and they returned and they wept,&#8221; which means they wept again. Here the weeping is put for the complaint, showing how emotionally stirred up the people had become by the craving. The words throughout here are metonymies. The craving is a metonymy of cause, for it would have then led to expressions (otherwise the desires would not have been known). And the weeping is either a metonymy of effect, or of adjunct, for the actual complaints follow.<br /></span></span>   and <span class="w H559" data-lemma="H559">said</span>,  <span class="w H4310" data-lemma="H4310">“If</span> only we had <span class="w H1320" data-lemma="H1320">meat</span> to <span class="w H398" data-lemma="H398">eat!</span><span class="note"><span class="key">15</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The Hebrew expresses the strong wish or longing idiomatically: &#8220;Who will give us flesh to eat?&#8221; It is a rhetorical expression not intended to be taken literally, but merely to give expression to the longing they had.

<span class="verse Jer_12_7" data-osis="Jer.12.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>“I will <span class="w H5800" data-lemma="H5800">abandon</span> my <span class="w H1004" data-lemma="H1004">nation</span>.<span class="note"><span class="key">21</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my house.&#8221; Or &#8220;I have abandoned my nation.&#8221; The word &#8220;house&#8221; has been used throughout Jeremiah for both the temple (e.g., <ref id="19122, 19130">7:2, 10</ref>), the nation or people of Israel or of Judah (e.g. <ref id="19021, 19023">3:18, 20</ref>), or the descendants of Jacob (i.e., the Israelites, e.g., <ref id="18970">2:4</ref>). Here the parallelism argues that it refers to the nation of Judah. The translation throughout <ref id="19255-19267">vv. 5-17</ref> assumes that the verb forms are prophetic perfects, the form that conceives of the action as being as good as done. It is possible that the forms are true perfects and refer to a past destruction of Judah. If so, it may have been connected with the assaults against Judah in 598/7 <sc>b.c.</sc> by the Babylonians and the nations surrounding Judah recorded in <ref id="10217">2 Kgs 24:14</ref>. No other major recent English version reflects these as prophetic perfects besides NIV and NCV, which does not use the future until <ref id="19260">v. 10</ref>. Hence the translation is somewhat tentative. C. Feinberg, &#8220;Jeremiah,&#8221; <i>EBC</i> <ref id="99999">6:459</ref> takes them as prophetic perfects and H. Freedman (<i>Jeremiah</i> [SoBB], 88) mentions that as a possibility for explaining the presence of this passage here. For another example of an extended use of the prophetic perfect without imperfects interspersed see <ref id="1-17836">Isa 8:23-9:6</ref>. The translation assumes they are prophetic and are part of the <sc>Lord</sc>&#8217;s answer to the complaint about the prosperity of the wicked; both the wicked Judeans and the wicked nations God will use to punish them will be punished.<br /></span></span>   I will <span class="w H5203" data-lemma="H5203">forsake</span> <span class="w H853" data-lemma="H853">the</span> <span class="w H5159" data-lemma="H5159">people</span> I call my own.<span class="note"><span class="key">22</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my inheritance.&#8221;<br /></span></span>  I will <span class="w H5414" data-lemma="H5414">turn</span> my <span class="w H3033" data-lemma="H3033">beloved</span> <span class="t1">people<span class="note"><span class="key">23</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the beloved of my soul.&#8221; Here &#8220;soul&#8221; stands for the person and is equivalent to &#8220;my.&#8221;<br /></span></span> </span> over to the <span class="w H3709" data-lemma="H3709">power</span><span class="note"><span class="key">24</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;will give&#8230;into the hands of.&#8221;<br /></span></span>   of their <span class="w H341" data-lemma="H341">enemies</span>.  </span>

In the Hebrew text sentence is a question: &#8220;Is not my inheritance to me a bird of prey [or] a hyena/a speckled bird of prey?&#8221; The question expects a positive answer and so is rendered here as an affirmative statement. The meaning of the word &#8220;speckled&#8221; is debated. It occurs only here. BDB 840 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1464;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1463;</font> relates it to another word that occurs only once in <ref id="6654">Judg 5:30</ref> which is translated &#8220;dyed stuff.&#8221; <i>HALOT</i> 936 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1464;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1463;</font> relates a word found in the cognates meaning &#8220;hyena.&#8221; This is more likely and is the interpretation followed by the Greek which reads the first two words as &#8220;cave of hyena.&#8221; This translation has led some scholars to posit a homonym for the word &#8220;bird of prey&#8221; meaning &#8220;cave&#8221; which is based on Arabic parallels. The metaphor would then be of Israel carried off by hyenas and surrounded by birds of prey. The evidence for the meaning &#8220;cave&#8221; is weak and would involve a wordplay of a rare homonym with another word that is better known. For a discussion of the issues see J. Barr, <i>Comparative Philology and the Text of the Old Testament</i>, 128-29, 153.<br /></span></span>   But other <span class="w H5861" data-lemma="H5861">birds of prey</span> are all <span class="w H5439" data-lemma="H5439">around</span> them.<span class="note"><span class="key">30</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Are birds of prey around her?&#8221; The question is again rhetorical and expects a positive answer. The birds of prey are of course the hostile nations surrounding her. The metaphor involved in these two lines may be interpreted differently. I.e., God considers Israel a proud bird of prey (hence the word for speckled) but one who is surrounded and under attack by other birds of prey. The fact that the sentences are divided into two rhetorical questions speaks somewhat against this.<br /></span></span> <span class="w H1980" data-lemma="H1980">Let</span> <span class="w H3605" data-lemma="H3605">all</span> the nations <span class="w H622" data-lemma="H622">gather together</span> like <span class="w H7704" data-lemma="H7704">wild</span> <span class="w H2416" data-lemma="H2416">beasts</span>.

Cf. the notes on <ref id="19060">5:1</ref> for further discussion. Since translating literally would raise question about who the commands are addressed to, they have been turned into passive third person commands to avoid confusion. The metaphor has likewise been turned into a simile to help the modern reader. By the way, the imperatives here implying future action argue that the passage is future and that it is correct to take the verb forms as prophetic perfects.<br /></span></span> </span>

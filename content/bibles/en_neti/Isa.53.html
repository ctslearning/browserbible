No, they are repentant sinners, who finally see the light. The phrase &#8220;our report&#8221; can mean (1) the report which we deliver, or (2) the report which was delivered to us.

The relationship between this line and the preceding one is uncertain. The parallelism appears to be synonymous (note &#8220;his grave&#8221; and &#8220;in his death&#8221;), but &#8220;criminals&#8221; and &#8220;the rich&#8221; hardly make a compatible pair in this context, for they would not be buried in the same kind of tomb. Some emend <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ashir</font>, &#8220;rich&#8221;) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1461;&#1497; &#1512;&#1464;&#1506;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ase ra</font>&#8217;, &#8220;doers of evil&#8221;) but the absence of the <i>ayin</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;</font>) is not readily explained in this graphic environment. Others suggest an emendation to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">s&#255;</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">irim</font>, &#8220;he-goats, demons&#8221;), but the meaning in this case is not entirely transparent and the proposal assumes that the form suffered from both transposition and the inexplicable loss of a final <i>mem</i>. Still others relate <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ashir</font>) to an alleged Arabic cognate meaning &#8220;mob.&#8221; See <i>HALOT</i> 896 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;</font>. Perhaps the parallelism is antithetical, rather than synonymous. In this case, the point is made that the servant&#8217;s burial in a rich man&#8217;s tomb, in contrast to a criminal&#8217;s burial, was appropriate, for he had done nothing wrong.<br /></span></span> <span class="w H5921" data-lemma="H5921">because</span><span class="note"><span class="key">27</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> If the second line is antithetical, then <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>) is probably causal here, explaining why the servant was buried in a rich man&#8217;s tomb, rather than that of criminal.

However, the servant is only addressed once in this servant song (see <ref id="18711">52:14</ref>a), and God either speaks or is spoken about in this servant song; he is never addressed. Furthermore, the idea of God himself making a reparation offering is odd. If the verb is taken as third feminine singular, then the feminine noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nefesh</font>) at the end of the line is the likely subject.

Some might think his suffering, but the preceding context views this as past, while the verb here is imperfect in form. The offering appears to be something the servant does after his suffering has been completed. Perhaps the background of the language can be found in the Levitical code, where a healed leper would offer a reparation offering as part of the ritual to achieve ceremonial cleanliness (see Lev 14). The servant was pictured earlier in the song as being severely ill. This illness (a metaphor for the effects of the people&#8217;s sin) separated him from God. However, here we discover the separation is not final; once reparation is made, so to speak, he will again experience the Lord&#8217;s favor.<br /></span></span>   he will <span class="w H7200" data-lemma="H7200">see</span> <span class="w H2233" data-lemma="H2233">descendants</span> and enjoy <span class="w H748" data-lemma="H748">long</span> <span class="w H3117" data-lemma="H3117">life</span>,<span class="note"><span class="key">29</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> The idiomatic and stereotypical language emphasizes the servant&#8217;s restoration to divine favor.

The precise meaning of the verb (the Hiphil of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1511;</font>, <font face="Scholar">tsadaq</font>) is debated. Elsewhere the Hiphil is used at least six times in the sense of &#8220;make righteous&#8221; in a legal sense, i.e., &#8220;pronounce innocent, acquit&#8221; (see <ref id="2152">Exod 23:7</ref>; <ref id="5549">Deut 25:1</ref>; <ref id="9018">1 Kgs 8:32</ref> = <ref id="11306">2 Chr 6:23</ref>; <ref id="16889">Prov 17:15</ref>; <ref id="17763">Isa 5:23</ref>). It can also mean &#8220;render justice&#8221; (as a royal function, see <ref id="8394">2 Sam 15:4</ref>; <ref id="15237">Ps 82:3</ref>), &#8220;concede&#8221; (<ref id="13487">Job 27:5</ref>), &#8220;vindicate&#8221; (<ref id="18671">Isa 50:8</ref>), and &#8220;lead to righteousness&#8221; (by teaching and example, <ref id="22085">Dan 12:3</ref>). The preceding context and the next line suggest a legal sense here. Because of his willingness to carry the people&#8217;s sins, the servant is able to &#8220;acquit&#8221; them.<br /><br/></br><b>sn</b> Some (e.g., H. M. Orlinsky, &#8220;The So-called &#8216;Suffering Servant&#8217; in Isaiah 53,22,&#8221; VTSup 14 [1967]: 3-133) object to this legal interpretation of the language, arguing that it would be unjust for the righteous to suffer for the wicked and for the wicked to be declared innocent. However, such a surprising development is consistent with the ironic nature of this song. It does seem unfair for the innocent to die for the guilty. But what is God to do when all have sinned and wandered off like stray sheep (cf. <ref id="18718">v. 6</ref>)? Covenant law demands punishment, but punishment in this case would mean annihilation of what God has created. God&#8217;s justice, as demanded by the law, must be satisfied. To satisfy his justice, he does something seemingly unjust. He punishes his sinless servant, the only one who has not strayed off! In the progress of biblical revelation, we discover that the sinless servant is really God in the flesh, who offers himself because he is committed to the world he has created. If his justice can only be satisfied if he himself endures the punishment, then so be it. What appears to be an act of injustice is really love satisfying the demands of justice!<br /></span></span>   for he <span class="w H5445" data-lemma="H5445">carried</span> their <span class="w H5771" data-lemma="H5771">sins</span>.<span class="note"><span class="key">33</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The circumstantial clause (note the <i>vav</i> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>] + object + subject + verb pattern) is understood as causal here.

Its two broad categories of translation are &#8220;much&#8221;/&#8220;many&#8221; and &#8220;great&#8221; (<i>HALOT</i> 1171-72 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1463;&#1489;</font>). Unlike other Hebrew terms for might or strength, this term is linked with numbers or abundance. In all sixteen uses outside of <ref id="18710-18724">Isaiah 52:13-53:12</ref> (articular and plural) it signifies an inclusive meaning: &#8220;the majority&#8221; or &#8220;the multitude&#8221; (J. Jeremias, <i>TDNT</i> 6:536-37). This term occurs in parallelism with <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">atsumim</font>), which normally signifies &#8220;numerous&#8221; or &#8220;large&#8221; or &#8220;powerful&#8221; (through large numbers).

Deut 4:38; 7:1; 9:1; 11:34). It emphasizes the multitudes with whom the Servant will share the spoil of his victory. As J.

These numerous peoples in turn receive blessing, sharing in the &#8220;peace&#8221; resulting from Yahweh&#8217;s victory and the Servant&#8217;s suffering&#8221; (John W.

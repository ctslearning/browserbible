<h3>The Presence of the Lord</h3>

<span class="verse Exod_33_7" data-osis="Exod.33.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="w H4872" data-lemma="H4872">Moses</span><span class="note"><span class="key">16</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> This unit of the book could actually include all of chap. 33, starting with the point of the <sc>Lord</sc>&#8217;s withdrawal from the people. If that section is not part of the exposition, it would have to be explained as the background. The point is that sinfulness prevents the active presence of the <sc>Lord</sc> leading his people. But then the rest of chap. 33 forms the development. In <ref id="2481-2485">vv. 7-11</ref> there is the gracious provision: the <sc>Lord</sc> reveals through his faithful mediator. The <sc>Lord</sc> was leading his people, but now more remotely because of their sin. Then, in <ref id="2476-2491">vv. 12-17</ref> Moses intercedes for the people, and the intercession of the mediator guarantees the <sc>Lord</sc>&#8217;s presence. The point of all of this is that God wanted the people to come to know that if he was not with them they should not go. Finally, the presence of the <sc>Lord</sc> is verified to the mediator by a special revelation (18-23). The point of the whole chapter is that by his grace the <sc>Lord</sc> renews the promise of his presence by special revelation.<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H3947" data-lemma="H3947">took</span><span class="note"><span class="key">17</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and Moses took.&#8221;<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H853" data-lemma="H853">the</span> <span class="w H168" data-lemma="H168">tent</span><span class="note"><span class="key">18</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> A widespread contemporary view is that this section represents a source that thought the tent of meeting was already erected (see S. R. Driver, <i>Exodus</i>, 359). But the better view is that this is a temporary tent used for meeting the <sc>Lord</sc>. U. Cassuto explains this view very well (<i>Exodus</i>, 429-30), namely, that because the building of the tabernacle was now in doubt if the <sc>Lord</sc> was not going to be in their midst, another plan seemed necessary. Moses took this tent, his tent, and put some distance between the camp and it. Here he would use the tent as the place to meet God, calling it by the same name since it was a surrogate tent.

But God would let him see his goodness, the sum of his nature, pass by in a flash. B.

Obviously, in this passage the recipients of that favor are the penitent Israelites who were forgiven through Moses&#8217; intercession. The two words are at the heart of God&#8217;s dealings with people. The first is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1504;&#1463;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khanan</font>, &#8220;to be gracious, show favor&#8221;). It means to grant favor or grace to someone, grace meaning unmerited favor. All of God&#8217;s dealings are gracious, but especially in forgiving sins and granting salvation it is critical. Parallel to this is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rakham</font>), a word that means &#8220;show compassion, tender mercy.&#8221; It is a word that is related to the noun &#8220;womb,&#8221; the connection being in providing care and protection for that which is helpless and dependent &#8211; a motherly quality. In both of these constructions the verbs simply express what God will do, without explaining why. See further, J. R.

As S. R. Driver says, though, while this may indicate just the &#8220;afterglow&#8221; that he leaves behind him, it was enough to suggest what the full brilliancy of his presence must be (<i>Exodus</i>, 363; see also <ref id="13482">Job 26:14</ref>).<br /></span></span>   but my <span class="w H6440" data-lemma="H6440">face</span> must <span class="w H3808" data-lemma="H3808">not</span> be <span class="w H7200" data-lemma="H7200">seen</span>.”<span class="note"><span class="key">65</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The Niphal imperfect could simply be rendered &#8220;will not be seen,&#8221; but given the emphasis of the preceding verses, it is more binding than that, and so a negated obligatory imperfect fits better: &#8220;it must not be seen.&#8221; It would also be possible to render it with a potential imperfect tense: &#8220;it cannot be seen.&#8221;<br /></span></span>    </span>

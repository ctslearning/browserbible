However, in this revelation the fire is coming from within the bush, not from outside, and it represents the <sc>Lord</sc> who will deliver his people from persecution. See further E.

A sign is often an unusual or miraculous event that introduces, authenticates, or illustrates the message. One expects a direct connection between the sign and the message (for a helpful discussion, see S. Por&#250;bcan, &#8220;The Word &#8217;OT in Isaia 7,14,&#8221; <i>CBQ</i> 22 [1960]: 144-49). In this passage the sign is a confirming one, i.e., when Israel worships at the mountain that will be the proof that God delivered them from Egypt.

The argument of this whole section nullifies that view. The idea that God&#8217;s name was revealed only here raises the question of what he was called earlier. The word &#8220;God&#8221; is not a name. &#8220;El Shaddai&#8221; is used only a few times in Genesis. But Israel would not have had a nameless deity &#8211; especially since Genesis says that from the very beginning people were making proclamation of the name of Yahweh (<ref id="106, 307">Gen 4:26; 12:8</ref>). It is possible that they did not always need a name if they were convinced that only he existed and there was no other God. But probably what Moses was anticipating was the Israelites&#8217; wanting to be sure that Moses came with a message from their God, and that some sign could prove it. They would have known his name (Yahweh), and they would have known the ways that he had manifested himself. It would do no good for Moses to come with a new name for God, for that would be like introducing them to a new God. That would in no way authenticate to them Moses&#8217; call, only confuse; after all, they would not be expecting a new name &#8211; they had been praying to their covenant God all along. They would want to be sure that their covenant God actually had sent Moses. To satisfy the Israelites Moses would have had to have been familiar with the name Yahweh &#8211; as they were &#8211; and know that he appeared to individuals. They would also want to know if Yahweh had sent Moses, how this was going to work in their deliverance, because they had been crying to him for deliverance. As it turned out, the Israelites had less problem with this than Moses anticipated &#8211; they were delighted when he came. It is likely that much of this concern was Moses&#8217; own need for assurance that this was indeed the God of the fathers and that the promised deliverance was now to take place.<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H4100" data-lemma="H4100">what</span> should I <span class="w H559" data-lemma="H559">say</span><span class="note"><span class="key">46</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The imperfect tense here has a deliberative nuance (&#8220;should&#8221;), for Moses is wondering what would be best to say when the Israelites want proof of the calling.<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H413" data-lemma="H413">to</span> them?” </span>

It forms an excellent paronomasia with the name. So when God used the verb to express his name, he used this form saying, &#8220;<sc>I am</sc>.&#8221; When his people refer to him as Yahweh, which is the third person masculine singular form of the same verb, they say &#8220;he is.&#8221; Some commentators argue for a future tense translation, &#8220;I will be who I will be,&#8221; because the verb has an active quality about it, and the Israelites lived in the light of the promises for the future. They argue that &#8220;<sc>I am</sc>&#8221; would be of little help to the Israelites in bondage. But a translation of &#8220;I will be&#8221; does not effectively do much more except restrict it to the future. The idea of the verb would certainly indicate that God is not bound by time, and while he is present (&#8220;<sc>I am</sc>&#8221;) he will always be present, even in the future, and so &#8220;<sc>I am</sc>&#8221; would embrace that as well (see also <ref id="7163">Ruth 2:13</ref>; <ref id="14690">Ps 50:21</ref>; <ref id="22104">Hos 1:9</ref>). The Greek translation of the OT used a participle to capture the idea, and several times in the Gospels Jesus used the powerful &#8220;I am&#8221; with this significance (e.g., <ref id="26440">John 8:58</ref>). The point is that Yahweh is sovereignly independent of all creation and that his presence guarantees the fulfillment of the covenant (cf. <ref id="18456, 18487, 18489, 18516-18517, 18540, 18567-18569">Isa 41:4; 42:6, 8; 43:10-11; 44:6; 45:5-7</ref>).

When God &#8220;visited&#8221; someone, it meant that he intervened in their lives to change their circumstances or their destiny. When he visited the Amalekites, he destroyed them (<ref id="7563">1 Sam 15:2</ref>). When he visited Sarah, he provided the long awaited child (<ref id="515">Gen 21:1</ref>). It refers to God&#8217;s active involvement in human affairs for blessing or for cursing. Here it would mean that God had begun to act to deliver the Israelites from bondage and give them the blessings of the covenant. The form is joined here with the infinitive absolute to underscore the certainty &#8211; &#8220;I have indeed visited you.&#8221; Some translate it &#8220;remember&#8221;; others say &#8220;watch over.&#8221; These do not capture the idea of intervention to bless, and often with the idea of vengeance or judgment on the oppressors. If God were to visit what the Egyptians did, he would stop the oppression and also bring retribution for it. The nuance of the perfect tense could be a perfect of resolve (&#8220;I have decided to visit&#8221;), or an instantaneous perfect ( &#8220;I hereby visit&#8221;), or a prophetic perfect (&#8220;I have visited&#8221; = &#8220;I will visit&#8221;). The infinitive absolute reinforces the statement (so &#8220;carefully&#8221;), the rendering &#8220;attended to&#8221; attempts to convey the ideas of personal presence, mental awareness, and action, as when a nurse or physician &#8220;attends&#8221; a patient.<br /><br/></br><b>sn</b> The same word was used in the same kind of construction at the end of Genesis (<ref id="99999">50:24</ref>) when Joseph promised, &#8220;God will surely visit you&#8221; (but there the imperfect tense with the infinitive absolute).

Some have taken <ref id="1599">v. 19</ref>b to refer to God&#8217;s mighty hand also, meaning that the king would not let them go unless a mighty hand compels him (NIV). The expression &#8220;mighty hand&#8221; is used of God&#8217;s rescuing Israel elsewhere (<ref id="1657, 1877, 1877">Exod 6:1; 13:9, 32</ref>:11; but note also <ref id="4332">Num 20:20</ref>). This idea is a rather general interpretation of the words; it owes much to the LXX, which has &#8220;except by a mighty hand,&#8221; though &#8220;and not with&#8221; does not have the meaning of &#8220;except&#8221; or &#8220;unless&#8221; in other places. In view of these difficulties, others have suggested that <ref id="1599">v. 19</ref>b means &#8220;strong [threats]&#8221; from the Israelites (as in <ref id="1626">4:24</ref>ff. and <ref id="99999">5:3</ref>; see B. Jacob, <i>Exodus</i>, 81). This does not seem as convincing as the first view. Another possibility is that the phrase conveys Pharaoh&#8217;s point of view and intention; the Lord knows that Pharaoh plans to resist letting the Israelites go, regardless of the exercise of a strong hand against him (P. Addinall, &#8220;Exodus III 19B and the Interpretation of Biblical Narrative,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 49 [1999]: 289-300; see also the construction &#8220;and not with&#8221; in <ref id="4068">Num 12:8</ref>; <ref id="7746">1 Sam 20:15</ref> and elsewhere). If that is the case, <ref id="1600">v. 20</ref> provides an ironic and pointed contradiction to Pharaoh&#8217;s plans as the Lord announces the effect that his hand will have. At any rate, Pharaoh will have to be forced to let Israel go.<br /></span></span>   </span>

So when the text says that they will ask (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1458;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">v&#255;sha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">alah</font>) their neighbors for things, it implies that they will be making many demands, and the Egyptians will respond like a defeated nation before victors. The spoils that Israel takes are to be regarded as back wages or compensation for the oppression (see also <ref id="5333">Deut 15:13</ref>). See further B.

But in view of the juxtaposition of the first part, this seems to make good sense. E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 42) has &#8220;Shall we address you?

In the book we have already read about the &#8220;sons of God&#8221; who take their stand as servants before the <sc>Lord</sc> (<ref id="12876, 12893">1:6; 2:1</ref>). And <ref id="15576">Ps 104:4</ref> identifies the angels as servants (using <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1514;</font>, <font face="Scholar">sharat</font>).<br /></span></span>   and <span class="w H7760" data-lemma="H7760">attributes</span><span class="note"><span class="key">64</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sim</font>, &#8220;set&#8221;) with the preposition <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">bet</font>) has the sense of &#8220;impute&#8221; or &#8220;attribute something to someone.&#8221;<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H8417" data-lemma="H8417">folly</span><span class="note"><span class="key">65</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;&#1459;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">toholah</font>) is a <i>hapax legomenon</i>, and so has created some confusion in the various translations. It seems to mean &#8220;error; folly.&#8221; The word is translated &#8220;perverseness&#8221; in the LXX; but Symmachus connects it with the word for &#8220;madness.&#8221; &#8220;Some commentators have repointed the word to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">t&#255;hillah</font>, &#8220;praise&#8221;) making the line read: &#8220;he finds no [cause for] praise in his angels.&#8221; Others suggest <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tiflah</font>, &#8220;offensiveness, silliness&#8221;) a bigger change; this matches the idiom in <ref id="13449">Job 24:12</ref>. But if the etymology of the word is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">halal</font>, &#8220;to be mad&#8221;) then that change is not necessary. The feminine noun &#8220;madness&#8221; still leaves the meaning of the line a little uncertain: &#8220;[if] he does not impute madness to his angels.&#8221; The point of the verse is that God finds flaws in his angels and does not put his trust in them.<br /></span></span>   to his <span class="w H4397" data-lemma="H4397">angels</span>,  </span>

In <ref id="28867">2 Cor 4:7</ref> the body is an &#8220;earthen vessel&#8221; &#8211; a clay pot. The verse continues the analogy: houses have foundations, and the house of clay is founded on dust, and will return to dust (<ref id="75">Gen 3:19</ref>; <ref id="15564">Ps 103:14</ref>). The reasoning is that if God finds defects in angels, he will surely find them in humans who are inferior to the angels because they are but dust.

Otherwise, the interpretation must offer some explanation of a comparison between how quickly a moth and a human can be crushed. There are suggestions for different readings here; see for example G. R. Driver, &#8220;Linguistic and Textual Problems: Jeremiah,&#8221; <i>JQR</i> 28 (1937/38): 97-129 for a change to &#8220;bird&#8217;s nest&#8221;; and J. A.

One suggested emendation does have the LXX in its favor, namely, a reading of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1506;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">moshia</font>&#8217;, &#8220;one who saves&#8221;) in place of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1461;&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mesim</font>, &#8220;one who sets&#8221;).

This would indicate that their life was compared to a tent &#8211; perfectly reasonable in a passage that has already used the image &#8220;houses of clay.&#8221; The difficulty is that the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1505;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nasa</font>&#8217;) means more properly &#8220;to tear up; to uproot.&#8221; and not &#8220;to cut off.&#8221; A similar idea is found in <ref id="18403">Isa 38:12</ref>, but there the image is explicitly that of cutting the life off from the loom. Some have posited that the original must have said their tent peg was pulled up&#8221; as in <ref id="18300">Isa 33:20</ref> (A. B. Davidson, <i>Job</i>, 34; cf. NAB). But perhaps the idea of &#8220;what remains&#8221; would be easier to defend here. Besides, it is used in <ref id="13410">22:20</ref>. The wealth of an individual is what has been acquired and usually is left over when he dies. Here it would mean that the superfluous wealth would be snatched away.

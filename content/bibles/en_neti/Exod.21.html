A precept is stated, and then various cases in which the law is applicable are examined. These rulings are all in harmony with the Decalogue that has just been given and can be grouped into three categories: civil or criminal laws, religious or cultic laws, and moral or humanitarian laws. The civil and criminal laws make up most of chap. 21; the next two chapters mix the other kinds of laws. Among the many studies of this section of the book are F. C. Fensham, &#8220;The Role of the Lord in the Legal Sections of the Covenant Code,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 26 (1976): 262-74; S. Paul, &#8220;Unrecognized Biblical Legal Idioms in Light of Comparative Akkadian Expressions,&#8221; <i>RB</i> 86 (1979): 231-39; M. Galston, &#8220;The Purpose of the Law According to Maimonides,&#8221; <i>JQR</i> 69 (1978): 27-51.<br /></span></span>   are the <span class="w H4941" data-lemma="H4941">decisions</span> <span class="w H834" data-lemma="H834">that</span> you will <span class="w H7760" data-lemma="H7760">set</span> <span class="w H6440" data-lemma="H6440">before</span> them: </span>

In this case, the wife and the children are actually the possession of the master unless the slave were to pay the bride price &#8211; but he is a slave because he got into debt.

It may indicate that the child was killed, as in a miscarriage; or it may mean that there was a premature birth. The latter view is taken here because of the way the whole section is written: (1) &#8220;her children come out&#8221; reflects a birth and not the loss of children, (2) there is no serious damage, and (3) payment is to be set for any remuneration.

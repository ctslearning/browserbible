The subject picks up the subjects of the first half of the verse, indicating they are equal &#8211; the tillage consists of the arrogance and pride. The word &#8220;tillage&#8221; is figurative, of course, signifying that the agricultural product (the point of the comparison) of the wicked is sin. The relationship between the ideas is then problematic. Are pride and arrogance what the wicked produce? Some (ASV, NASB, NIV, NRSV) have followed the LXX and <i>Tg</i>. <ref id="16989">Prov 21:4</ref> to read &#8220;lamp&#8221; instead (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1461;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">ner</font>), but that does not solve the difficulty of the relationship between the expressions.

The word &#8220;hasty&#8221; has the idea of being pressed or pressured into quick actions. So the text contrasts calculated expeditiousness with unproductive haste. C. H. Toy does not like this contrast, and so proposes changing the latter to &#8220;lazy&#8221; (<i>Proverbs</i> [ICC], 399), but W.

NAB &#8220;He who makes&#8221;).

The point of the metaphor is that the ill-gotten gains will vanish into thin air. The LXX has &#8220;pursues&#8221; (as if reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1465;&#1491;&#1461;&#1507;</font>, <font face="Scholar">rodef</font>); cf.

The Greek and the Latin versions have &#8220;snares of death&#8221;; the form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1511;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">moq&#255;she</font>) was read instead of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1489;&#1463;&#1511;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">m&#255;vaqshe</font>). This reading does not make a more credible metaphor, and one must explain the loss of the letter <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;</font> (<i>bet</i>) in the textual variant. It is, however, slightly easier to interpret in the verse, and is followed by a number of English versions (e.g., NAB, NIV, NRSV, NLT).

Since <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1464;&#1494;&#1464;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vazar</font>) occurs only here it has been given much attention. The translation of &#8220;guilty&#8221; is drawn from an Arabic cognate meaning &#8220;to bear a burden&#8221; and so &#8220;to be sin laden&#8221; or &#8220;guilty&#8221; (cf. NASB, NIV, NCV, NRSV, NLT). G. R. Driver prefers to read the line as &#8220;a man crooked of ways is false [<i>zar</i>]&#8221; (&#8220;Problems in the Hebrew Text of Proverbs,&#8221; <i>Bib</i> 32 [1951]: 185). C. H. Toy adopts the meaning of &#8220;proud&#8221; (<i>Proverbs</i> [ICC], 400). Whatever the reading, &#8220;guilty&#8221; or &#8220;proud&#8221; or &#8220;false,&#8221; the idea is that such people are devious. Bad people are underhanded; good people are aboveboard (C. H. Toy, <i>Proverbs</i> [ICC], 400). Another way to analyze the line is to read it with the definition &#8220;strange, stranger&#8221;: &#8220;The way of a man and a stranger is perverse.&#8221; But this is unclear, and would form no satisfactory contrast to 8b. Another suggestion is &#8220;the way of (usual) man is changeable and strange, but the pure fellow leads a straight and even course&#8221; (J. H. Greenstone, <i>Proverbs</i>, 244); cf.

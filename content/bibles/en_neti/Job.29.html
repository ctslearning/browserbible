Since this is the autumn, many translate that way here &#8211; but &#8220;autumn&#8221; has a different connotation now. The text is pointing to a time when the righteous reaps what he has sown, and can enjoy the benefits. The translation &#8220;most productive time&#8221; seems to capture the point better than &#8220;autumn&#8221; or even &#8220;prime.&#8221;<br /></span></span>   when <span class="w H433" data-lemma="H433">God’s</span> <span class="w H5475" data-lemma="H5475">intimate friendship</span><span class="note"><span class="key">14</span><span class="text"><b>tc</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sod</font>) in this verse is an infinitive construct, prefixed with the temporal preposition and followed by a subjective genitive. It forms a temporal clause. There is some disagreement about the form and its meaning. The confusion in the versions shows that they were paraphrasing to get the general sense. In the Bible the derived noun (from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1505;&#1463;&#1491;</font>, <font face="Scholar">yasad</font>) means (a) a circle of close friends; (b) intimacy. Others follow the LXX and the Syriac with a meaning of &#8220;protect,&#8221; based on a change from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1491;</font> (<font face="Scholar">dalet</font>) to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kaf</font>), and assuming the root was <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sakhakh</font>). This would mean, &#8220;when God protected my tent&#8221; (cf. NAB). D. W. Thomas tries to justify this meaning without changing the text (&#8220;The Interpretation of <font face="Scholar">BSO&#221;D</font> in <ref id="13537">Job 29:4</ref>,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 65 [1946]: 63-66).<br /></span></span>   was <span class="t1">experienced</span> <span class="w H5921" data-lemma="H5921">in</span> my <span class="w H168" data-lemma="H168">tent</span>,  </span>

The figure cannot be pushed too far. But the verse apparently has caused enormous problems, because the versions offer a variety of readings and free paraphrases. The LXX has &#8220;My age shall grow old as the stem of a palm tree, I shall live a long time.&#8221; The Vulgate has, &#8220;In my nest I shall die and like the palm tree increase my days.&#8221; G. R. Driver found an Egyptian word meaning &#8220;strength&#8221; (&#8220;Birds in the Old Testament,&#8221; <i>PEQ</i> 87 [1955]: 138-39). Several read &#8220;in a ripe old age&#8221; instead of &#8220;in my nest&#8221; (Pope, Dhorme; see P. P. Saydon, &#8220;Philological and Textual Notes to the Maltese Translation of the Old Testament,&#8221; <i>CBQ</i> 23 [1961]: 252).

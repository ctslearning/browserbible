<h3>Miriam and Aaron Oppose Moses</h3>
<p>
<span class="verse Num_12_1" data-osis="Num.12.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Then<span class="note"><span class="key">1</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> In this short chapter we find a prime example of jealousy among leaders and how God dealt with it. Miriam and Aaron are envious of Moses&#8217; leadership, but they use an occasion &#8211; his marriage &#8211; to criticize him. Often the immediate criticism is simply a surface issue for a deeper matter. God indicates very clearly he will speak through many people, including them, but Moses is different. Moses is the mediator of the covenant. The chapter is a lesson of what not to do. They should have fulfilled their duties before God and not tried to compete or challenge the leader in this way. There is a touch of divine irony here, for Miriam is turned white with leprosy. The chapter falls easily into the sections of the story: the accusation (<ref id="4061-4063">vv. 1-3</ref>), the <sc>Lord</sc>&#8217;s response (<ref id="4064-4070">vv. 4-10</ref>), the intercession of Moses (<ref id="4061-4076">vv. 11-16</ref>). For further information, see J. S. Kselman, &#8220;A Note on <ref id="4066-4068">Numbers 12:6-8</ref>,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 26 (1976): 500-504.<br /></span></span> <span class="w H4813" data-lemma="H4813">Miriam</span> and <span class="w H175" data-lemma="H175">Aaron</span> <span class="w H1696" data-lemma="H1696">spoke</span> <span class="w H5921" data-lemma="H5921">against</span><span class="note"><span class="key">2</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The preposition <font face="Scholar">bet</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;</font>) has the adversative sense here, &#8220;[speak] against&#8221; (see also its use for hostile speech in <ref id="4346, 4348">21:5, 7</ref>). Speaking against is equal to the murmuring throughout the wilderness period. The verb of the sentence is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1491;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">vatt&#255;dabber</font>), the <font face="Scholar">feminine</font> form of the verb. This indicates that Miriam was the main speaker for the two, the verb agreeing with the first of the compound subject.<br /><br/></br><b>sn</b> It may be that Miriam was envious of the Cushite woman Moses married. And, in view of the previous chapter&#8217;s content about others being given a portion of the Spirit to share in the leadership role, she may have seen this as her chance finally to become just as important in the nation as her younger brother. After all, she safeguarded his birth and early years (Exod 2). But there are two issues here &#8211; the reason she gives (&#8220;does the <sc>Lord</sc> only speak through Moses?&#8221;), and the reason the text gives (the Cushite woman).<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H4872" data-lemma="H4872">Moses</span> <span class="w H182" data-lemma="H182">because</span> of the <span class="w H3569" data-lemma="H3569">Cushite</span><span class="note"><span class="key">3</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The Hebrew text has <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1467;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;</font> (<i>hakkushit</i>, &#8220;the Cushite&#8221;) as the modifier of &#8220;woman.&#8221; The Greek text interpreted this correctly as &#8220;Ethiopian.&#8221; The word Cush in the Bible can describe the Cassites, east of Babylon of the later period (<ref id="253">Gen 10:18</ref>), or Ethiopia (<ref id="18033">Isa 20:3</ref>; <ref id="22718">Nah 3:5</ref>; et al). Another suggestion is that it would refer to Cushan of <ref id="22776">Hab 3:7</ref>, perhaps close to Midian, and so the area Moses had been. This would suggest it could be Zipporah &#8211; but the Bible does not identify the Cushite as Zipporah. The most natural understanding would be that it refers to an Egyptian/Ethiopian woman. The text does not say when Moses married this woman, or what Miriam&#8217;s problem with her was. It is clear that it was a racial issue, by virtue of the use of &#8220;Cushite.&#8221; Whether she was of darker skin than the Hebrews would be hard to say, since the Bible gives no further detail. Neither does it say if this is a second wife, or a woman Moses married since Zipporah went home (<ref id="2002">Exod 18:2</ref>). These do not seem to be the issues the text wishes to elaborate on; it is simply stating that this woman was the occasion for a deeper challenge.<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H802" data-lemma="H802">woman</span> he had <span class="w H3947" data-lemma="H3947">married</span><span class="note"><span class="key">4</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;taken.&#8221;<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H3588" data-lemma="H3588">(for</span> he had <span class="w H3947" data-lemma="H3947">married</span> an <span class="w H3569" data-lemma="H3569">Ethiopian</span> <span class="w H802" data-lemma="H802">woman)</span>.  </span>

They ask if God has not also spoken through them, after they have spoken against Moses. Shortly God will speak against them &#8211; their words are prophetic, but not as they imagined.<br /><br/></br><b>sn</b> The questions are rhetorical. They are affirming that God does not only speak through Moses, but also speaks through them. They see themselves as equal with Moses. The question that was asked of the earlier presumptuous Moses &#8211; &#8220;Who made you a ruler over us?&#8221; &#8211; could also be asked of them. God had not placed them as equals with Moses. The passage is relevant for today when so many clamor for equal authority and leadership with those whom God has legitimately called.<br /></span></span>  And the <span class="w H3068" data-lemma="H3068">Lord</span> <span class="w H8085" data-lemma="H8085">heard</span> it.<span class="note"><span class="key">8</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> The statement is striking.

God singled out Moses and used him in such a way as to show that he was a unique leader. For a suggestion that the word means &#8220;miserable,&#8221; see C. Rogers, &#8220;Moses: Meek or Miserable?&#8221; <i>JETS</i> 29 (1986): 257-63.<br /><br/></br><b>sn</b> Humility is a quality missing today in many leaders. Far too many are self-promoting, or competitive, or even pompous. The statement in this passage would have been difficult for Moses to write &#8211; and indeed, it is not impossible that an editor might have added it. One might think that for someone to claim to be humble is an arrogant act. But the statement is one of fact &#8211; he was not self-assertive (until Num 20 when he strikes the rock).<br /></span></span>   more so than <span class="w H3605" data-lemma="H3605">any</span> <span class="w H120" data-lemma="H120">man</span>  <span class="w H5921" data-lemma="H5921">on</span> the <span class="w H6440" data-lemma="H6440">face</span> of the <span class="w H127" data-lemma="H127">earth</span>.)   </span>

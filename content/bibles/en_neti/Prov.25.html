<h3>Proverbs of Solomon Collected by Hezekiah</h3>

Some scholars conclude that this has no historical value other than to report the later disposition that people thought they came from Solomon&#8217;s time, but if that were the only consideration, then that in itself would have to be considered as a piece of historical information. But if the reference is an earlier note in the collection, then it becomes more valuable for consideration. The proverbs in these lines differ from the earlier ones in that these are multiple line sayings using more similes; chapters 28-29 are similar to 10-16, but chapters 25-27 differ in having few references to God.<br /></span></span>   </span>
<span class="verse Prov_25_2" data-osis="Prov.25.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>It is the <span class="w H3519" data-lemma="H3519">glory</span> of <span class="w H430" data-lemma="H430">God</span><span class="note"><span class="key">2</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> The proverb provides a contrast between God and the king, and therein is the clue to the range of application involved. The interest of the king is ruling or administering his government; and so the subject matter is a contrast to the way God rules his kingdom.<br /></span></span>   to <span class="w H5641" data-lemma="H5641">conceal</span><span class="note"><span class="key">3</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> The two infinitives form the heart of the contrast &#8211; &#8220;to conceal a matter&#8221; and &#8220;to search out a matter.&#8221; God&#8217;s government of the universe is beyond human understanding &#8211; humans cannot begin to fathom the intentions and operations of it. But it is the glory of kings to search out matters and make them intelligible to the people. Human government cannot claim divine secrecy; kings have to study and investigate everything before making a decision, even divine government as far as possible. But kings who rule as God&#8217;s representatives must also try to represent his will in human affairs &#8211; they must even inquire after God to find his will. This is their glorious nature and responsibility. For more general information on <ref id="17116-17141">vv. 2-27</ref>, see G. E.

While the king would make many things clear to the people, there are other things that are &#8220;above their heads&#8221; or &#8220;too deep for them.&#8221; They are unsearchable because of his superior wisdom, his caprice, or his need for secrecy. Inscrutability is sometimes necessary to keep a firm grip on power.<br /></span></span>   </span>

KJV, ASV, NASB). But purging dross from silver does not produce a &#8220;vessel&#8221; for the silversmith. Some versions therefore render it &#8220;material&#8221; (e.g., NIV, NRSV). The LXX says &#8220;that it will be entirely pure.&#8221; So D. W. Thomas reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">kalil</font>) and translates it &#8220;purified completely&#8221; (&#8220;Notes on Some Passages in the Book of Proverbs,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 15 [1965]: 271-79; cf. NAB). W. McKane simply rearranges the line to say that the smith can produce a work of art (<i>Proverbs</i> [OTL], 580; cf. TEV &#8220;a thing of beauty&#8221;). The easiest explanation is that &#8220;vessel&#8221; is a metonymy of effect, &#8220;vessel&#8221; put for the material that goes into making it (such metonymies occur fairly often in Psalms and Proverbs).<br /></span></span>   for the <span class="w H6884" data-lemma="H6884">silversmith</span> will <span class="w H3318" data-lemma="H3318">emerge;</span> </span>

Greenstone says, &#8220;The king may have perfect ideals and his conduct may be irreproachable, but he may be misled by unscrupulous courtiers&#8221; (<i>Proverbs</i>, 264).<br /></span></span>   </span>

McKane suggests that the expression is metaphorical for the balancing halves of a Hebrew parallel wisdom saying: &#8220;The <i>stichos</i> is a wheel, and the sentence consisting of two wheels is a &#8216;well-turned&#8217; expression&#8221; (<i>Proverbs</i> [OTL], 584).

Because snow at the time of harvest would be rare, and probably unwelcome, various commentators have sought to explain this expression. R. N.

Greenstone following Rashi, a Jewish scholar who lived <sc>a.d.</sc> 1040-1105, suggests it might refer to the refreshing breeze that comes from snow-capped mountains (<i>Proverbs</i>, 260). C. H. Toy suggests a snow-cooled drink (<i>Proverbs</i> [ICC], 464), and W. McKane an application of ice water to the forehead (<i>Proverbs</i> [OTL], 585). Some English versions replace &#8220;snow&#8221; with &#8220;water&#8221; (cf. TEV &#8220;cold water&#8221;; CEV &#8220;cool water&#8221;).

But the line may refer to the loss of social standing and position by the righteous due to the plots of the wicked &#8211; just as someone muddied the water, someone made the righteous slip from his place.<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H6440" data-lemma="H6440">before</span> the <span class="w H7563" data-lemma="H7563">wicked</span>.  </span>

MacIntosh suggests, &#8220;He who searches for glory will be distressed&#8221; (&#8220;A Note on <ref id="17141">Prov 25:27</ref>,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 20 [1970]: 112-14). G. E.

The Hebrew is cryptic, but not unintelligible: &#8220;seeking their glory [is not] glory.&#8221; It is saying that seeking one&#8217;s own glory is dishonorable.<br /></span></span>   </span>

TEV, CEV &#8220;flaming creatures&#8221;; NCV &#8220;heavenly creatures of fire&#8221;). Elsewhere in the OT the word &#8220;seraph&#8221; refers to poisonous snakes (<ref id="4347">Num 21:6</ref>; <ref id="5153">Deut 8:15</ref>; <ref id="17958, 18224">Isa <ref id="17958">14:29</ref>; 30:6</ref>). Perhaps they were called &#8220;burning ones&#8221; because of their appearance or the effect of their venomous bites, which would cause a victim to burn up with fever. It is possible that the seraphs seen by Isaiah were at least partially serpentine in appearance. Though it might seem strange for a snake-like creature to have wings, two of the texts where &#8220;seraphs&#8221; are snakes describe them as &#8220;flying&#8221; (<ref id="17958, 18224">Isa 14:29; 30:6</ref>), perhaps referring to their darting movements.

Hebrew sometimes uses repetition for emphasis. (See <i>IBHS</i> 233-34 &#167;12.5a; and GKC 431-32 &#167;133.<i>k</i>.) By repeating the word &#8220;holy,&#8221; the seraphs emphasize the degree of the Lord&#8217;s holiness. For another example of threefold repetition for emphasis, see <ref id="20972">Ezek 21:27</ref> (Heb. <ref id="99999">v. 32</ref>). (Perhaps <ref id="19484">Jer 22:29</ref> provides another example.)<br /><br/></br><b>sn</b> Or &#8220;The Lord who commands armies has absolute sovereign authority!&#8221; The basic sense of the word &#8220;holy&#8221; is &#8220;set apart from that which is commonplace, special, unique.&#8221; In this context the Lord&#8217;s holiness is first and foremost his transcendent sovereignty as the ruler of the world. He is &#8220;set apart&#8221; from the world over which he rules. Note the emphasis on the elevated position of his throne in <ref id="17771">v. 1</ref> and his designation as &#8220;the king&#8221; in <ref id="17775">v. 5</ref>. At the same time his holiness encompasses his moral authority, which derives from his royal position. As king he has the right to dictate to his subjects how they are to live; indeed his very own character sets the standard for proper behavior. He is &#8220;set apart&#8221; from his subjects in a moral sense as well. He sets the standard; they fall short of it. Note that in <ref id="17775">v. 5</ref> Isaiah laments that he is morally unworthy to be in the king&#8217;s presence.<br /></span></span>   is the <span class="w H3068" data-lemma="H3068">Lord</span> <span class="w H6635" data-lemma="H6635">who commands armies!</span><span class="note"><span class="key">6</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> Perhaps in this context, the title has a less militaristic connotation and pictures the Lord as the ruler of the heavenly assembly.

Does the Lord really want to prevent his people from understanding, repenting, and being healed? Verse 9, which ostensibly records the content of Isaiah&#8217;s message, is clearly ironic. As far as we know, Isaiah did not literally proclaim these exact words. The Hebrew imperatival forms are employed rhetorically and anticipate the response Isaiah will receive. When all is said and done, Isaiah might as well preface and conclude every message with these ironic words, which, though imperatival in form, might be paraphrased as follows: &#8220;You continually hear, but don&#8217;t understand; you continually see, but don&#8217;t perceive.&#8221; Isaiah might as well command them to be spiritually insensitive, because, as the preceding and following chapters make clear, the people are bent on that anyway. (This ironic command is comparable to saying to a particularly recalcitrant individual, &#8220;Go ahead, be stubborn!&#8221;) Verse 10b is also clearly sarcastic. On the surface it seems to indicate Isaiah&#8217;s hardening ministry will prevent genuine repentance. But, as the surrounding chapters clearly reveal, the people were hardly ready or willing to repent. Therefore, Isaiah&#8217;s preaching was not needed to prevent repentance! Verse 10b reflects the people&#8217;s attitude and might be paraphrased accordingly: &#8220;Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their mind, repent, and be restored, and they certainly wouldn&#8217;t want that, would they?&#8221; Of course, this sarcastic statement may also reveal that the Lord himself is now bent on judgment, not reconciliation. Just as Pharaoh&#8217;s rejection of Yahweh&#8217;s ultimatum ignited judgment and foreclosed, at least temporarily, any opportunity for repentance, so the Lord may have come to the point where he has decreed to bring judgment before opening the door for repentance once more. The sarcastic statement in verse 10b would be an emphatic way of making this clear. (Perhaps we could expand our paraphrase: &#8220;Otherwise they might&#8230;repent, and be restored, and they certainly wouldn&#8217;t want that, would they? Besides, it&#8217;s too late for that!&#8221;) Within this sarcastic framework, verse 10a must also be seen as ironic. As in verse 9 the imperatival forms should be taken as rhetorical and as anticipating the people&#8217;s response. One might paraphrase: &#8220;Your preaching will desensitize the minds of these people, make their hearing dull, and blind their eyes.&#8221; From the outset the Lord might as well command Isaiah to harden the people, because his preaching will end up having that effect. Despite the use of irony, we should still view this as a genuine, albeit indirect, act of divine hardening. After all, God did not have to send Isaiah. By sending him, he drives the sinful people further from him, for Isaiah&#8217;s preaching, which focuses on the Lord&#8217;s covenantal demands and impending judgment upon covenantal rebellion, forces the people to confront their sin and then continues to desensitize them as they respond negatively to the message. As in the case of Pharaoh, Yahweh&#8217;s hardening is not arbitrarily imposed on a righteous or even morally neutral object. Rather his hardening is an element of his righteous judgment on recalcitrant sinners. Ironically, Israel&#8217;s rejection of prophetic preaching in turn expedites disciplinary punishment, and brings the battered people to a point where they might be ready for reconciliation. The prophesied judgment (cf. <ref id="17781-17783">6:11-13</ref>) was fulfilled by 701 <sc>b.c.</sc> when the Assyrians devastated the land (a situation presupposed by <ref id="17657-17675">Isa 1:2-20</ref>; see especially <ref id="17774-17779">vv. 4-9</ref>). At that time the divine hardening had run its course and Isaiah is able to issue an ultimatum (<ref id="17674-17675">1:19-20</ref>), one which Hezekiah apparently took to heart, resulting in the sparing of Jerusalem (see Isa 36-39 and cf. <ref id="19591-19592">Jer 26:18-19</ref> with <ref id="22621">Mic 3:12</ref>).This interpretation, which holds in balance both Israel&#8217;s moral responsibility and the Lord&#8217;s sovereign work among his people, is consistent with other pertinent texts both within and outside the Book of Isaiah. <ref id="17717">Isa 3:9</ref> declares that the people of Judah &#8220;have brought disaster upon themselves,&#8221; but <ref id="18203-18204">Isa 29:9-10</ref> indicates that the Lord was involved to some degree in desensitizing the people. <ref id="22974-22975">Zech 7:11-12</ref> looks back to the pre-exilic era (cf. <ref id="17777">v. 7</ref>) and observes that the earlier generations stubbornly hardened their hearts, but <ref id="15229-15230">Ps 81:11-12</ref>, recalling this same period, states that the Lord &#8220;gave them over to their stubborn hearts.&#8221;<br /></span></span>    </span>

The tree (the nation) is chopped down, but the stump (a righteous remnant) remains from which God can restore the nation. However, if <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1510;&#1468;&#1462;&#1489;&#1462;&#1514;</font> is taken as &#8220;sacred pillar&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1510;&#1468;&#1462;&#1489;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">matsevah;</font> see the previous note), it is much more difficult to take the final statement in a positive sense. In this case &#8220;holy offspring&#8221; alludes to God&#8217;s ideal for his covenant people, the offspring of the patriarchs. Ironically that &#8220;holy&#8221; nation is more like a &#8220;sacred pillar&#8221; and it will be thrown down like a sacred pillar from a high place and its land destroyed like the sacred trees located at such shrines. Understood in this way, the ironic statement is entirely negative in tone, just like the rest of the preceding announcement of judgment. It also reminds the people of their failure; they did not oppose pagan religion, instead they embraced it. Now they will be destroyed in the same way they should have destroyed paganism.<br /></span></span>    </span>

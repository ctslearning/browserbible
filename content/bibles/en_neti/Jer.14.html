However, in the third line the figure is a little hard to sustain because &#8220;they&#8221; are in mourning on the ground. That presses the imagination of most moderns a little too far.

However, it cannot be a continuation of the <sc>Lord</sc>&#8217;s speech and the people have consistently refused to acknowledge their sin. The fact that the prayer here and in <ref id="19303-19316">vv. 19-22</ref> are followed by an address from God to Jeremiah regarding prayer (cf. <ref id="19039">4:11</ref> and the interchanges there between God and Jeremiah and <ref id="99999">15:1</ref>) also argues that the speaker is Jeremiah. He is again identifying with his people (cf. <ref id="19172-19178">8:18-9:2</ref>). Here he takes up the petition part of the lament which often contains elements of confession of sin and statements of trust. In 14:1-6 God portrays to Jeremiah the people&#8217;s lamentable plight instead of their describing it to him. Here Jeremiah prays what they should pray. The people are strangely silent throughout.<br /></span></span> </span> “O <span class="w H3068" data-lemma="H3068">Lord</span>,  <span class="w H6213" data-lemma="H6213">intervene</span> <span class="w H4616" data-lemma="H4616">for</span> the <span class="t1">honor</span> of your <span class="w H8034" data-lemma="H8034">name</span><span class="note"><span class="key">14</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Act for the sake of your name.&#8221; The usage of &#8220;act&#8221; in this absolute, unqualified sense cf.

The meaning of these two lines is debated because of the uncertainty of the meaning of the verb rendered &#8220;go about their business&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">sakhar</font>) and the last phrase translated here &#8220;without any real understanding.&#8221; The verb in question most commonly occurs as a participle meaning &#8220;trader&#8221; or &#8220;merchant&#8221; (cf., e.g., <ref id="21143, 21158">Ezek 27:21, 36</ref>; <ref id="17299">Prov 31:14</ref>). It occurs as a finite verb elsewhere only in <ref id="991, 1002, 1287">Gen 34:10, 21; 42:34</ref> and there in a literal sense of &#8220;trading,&#8221; &#8220;doing business.&#8221; While the nuance is metaphorical here it need not extend to &#8220;journeying into&#8221; (cf., e.g., BDB 695 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1512;</font> Qal.1) and be seen as a reference to exile as is sometimes assumed. That seems at variance with the causal particle which introduces this clause, the tense of the verb, and the surrounding context. People are dying in the land (<ref id="19301-19312">vv. 17-18</ref>a) not because prophet and priest have gone (the verb is the Hebrew perfect or past) into exile but because prophet and priest have no true knowledge of God or the situation. The clause translated here &#8220;without having any real understanding&#8221; (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;and they do not know&#8221;) is using the verb in the absolute sense indicated in BDB 394 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1506;</font> Qal.5 and illustrated in <ref id="17658, 18764">Isa 1:3; 56:10</ref>.

McKane, <i>Jeremiah</i> (ICC), <ref id="1-1">1:330-31</ref>.<br /><br/></br><b>sn</b> For the &#8220;business&#8221; of the prophets and priest see <ref id="18974, 19072, 19103, 19164">2:8; 5:13; 6:13; 8:10</ref>.

This is probably wrong. The Hebrew text reads: &#8220;Do not treat with contempt for the sake of your name; do not treat with disdain your glorious throne.&#8221; This is case of poetic parallelism where the object is left hanging until the second line. For an example of this see <ref id="16749">Prov 13:1</ref> in the original and consult E. W. Bullinger, <i>Figures of Speech,</i> 103-4. There has also been some disagreement whether &#8220;your glorious throne&#8221; refers to the temple (as in <ref id="19370">17:12</ref>) or Jerusalem (as in <ref id="19020">3:17</ref>). From the beginning of the prayer in <ref id="19313">v. 19</ref> where a similar kind of verb has been used with respect to Zion/Jerusalem it would appear that the contextual referent is Jerusalem.

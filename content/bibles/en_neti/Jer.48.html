Basically, it was the tableland between the Arnon River about halfway up the Dead Sea and the Zered River which is roughly at the southern tip of the Dead Sea. When the Israelites entered Palestine they were forbidden to take any of the Moabite territory but they did capture the kingdom of Sihon north of the Arnon which Sihon had taken from Moab. Several of the towns mentioned in the oracles of judgment against Moab here are in this territory north of the Arnon and were assigned to Reuben and Gad. Several are mentioned on the famous Moabite Stone which details how Mesha king of Moab recovered from Israel many of these cities during the reign of Joram (852-841 <sc>b.c.</sc>; cf. <ref id="9581-9582">2 Kgs 3:4-5</ref>). It is usually assumed that Moab submitted to Nebuchadnezzar after the battle of Carchemish and that they remained loyal to him throughout most of this period, though representatives were present at Jerusalem in 594 <sc>b.c.</sc> when plans for revolt were apparently being discussed (<ref id="19600">Jer 27:3</ref>). Moabite contingents were used by Nebuchadnezzar in 598 <sc>b.c.</sc> to harass Jehoiakim after he rebelled (<ref id="10205">2 Kgs 24:2</ref>) so they must have remained loyal at that time. According to the Jewish historian Josephus, Nebuchadnezzar conquered Moab in 582 <sc>b.c.</sc> and destroyed many of its cities.<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H1945" data-lemma="H1945">“Sure to be judged</span> is <span class="w H5015" data-lemma="H5015">Nebo!</span> <span class="w H3588" data-lemma="H3588">Indeed</span>,<span class="note"><span class="key">3</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Woe to Nebo for it is destroyed.&#8221; For the use of the Hebrew particle &#8220;Woe&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1497;</font>, <font face="Scholar">hoy</font>) see the translator&#8217;s note on <ref id="19468">22:13</ref>. The translation has taken this form because the phrase &#8220;Woe to&#8221; probably does not convey the proper meaning or significance to the modern reader.

The constant use of this word to refer to a fortress, the presence of the article on the front of it, and the lack of any reference to a place of this name anywhere else argues against it being a place name.

I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1464;&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;</font> 2 and see <ref id="1324">Gen 43:33</ref>).

However, that leaves the verb with an indefinite subject (the verb is active 3rd plural not passive) not otherwise identified in the preceding context. Many of the modern English versions such as NRSV, NJPS, NIV retain the Hebrew as the present translation has done. In this case the masculine plural noun furnishes a logical subject for the verb.<br /></span></span>   </span>

The causal particles at the beginning of the two halves of the verse suggest some connection with the preceding, so the translation assumes that the children are still the subject. In this case the singular verb would be a case of the distributive singular already referred to in the translator&#8217;s note on <ref id="20061">46:15</ref>. The parallel passage in <ref id="17966">Isa 15:5</ref> refers to the &#8220;fugitives&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1495;&#1462;&#1492;&#1464;</font>, <font face="Scholar">b&#255;rikheha</font>) with the same singular verb as here and that may be the implied subject here.<br /><br/></br><b>sn</b> The location of <i>Luhith</i> and <i>Horonaim</i> are uncertain, though, from their connection with Zoar in <ref id="17966">Isa 15:5</ref>, they appear to be located in southern Moab.

However, it is in all the Hebrew <sc>mss</sc> and in the other early versions, and it is hard to see why it would be added here if it were not original.<br /></span></span>   </span>

The translation follows one reading of the Hebrew text. The Greek version reads &#8220;Be like a wild donkey in the desert!&#8221; There are three points of debate in this line: the syntax of the verb form &#8220;be&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1460;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1462;&#1497;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">tihyenah</font>) and the text and meaning of the word translated &#8220;shrub&#8221; in the Hebrew text. This word only occurs with this meaning here and in <ref id="19364">Jer 17:6</ref>. A related word occurs in <ref id="15539">Ps 102:17</ref> (<ref id="99999">102:18</ref> HT). Elsewhere this spelling refers to the place name Aroer which was a place in Moab on the edge of the Arnon River. Most commentators do not feel that a reference to that place is appropriate here because it was not in the desert. The Greek version reads &#8220;like a wild donkey&#8221; (reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;</font> [<font face="Scholar">k&#255;</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">arod</font>] in place of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1506;&#1461;&#1512;</font> [<font face="Scholar">ka</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">aro</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">er</font>]). That would make an appropriate simile here because the wild donkey enjoys its freedom and is hard to capture. G. L. Keown, P. J. Scalise, and T. G. Smothers (<i>Jeremiah 26-52</i> [WBC], 312) explain the simile of the &#8220;shrub&#8221; as referring to the marginal and rudimentary existence of a displaced person. That may not be as optimistic as the reference to the wild donkey but it does give an appropriate meaning. The third feminine plural has been explained as the singular noun + suffix = &#8220;yourselves&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1463;&#1508;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1499;&#1462;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">nafsh&#255;khem</font>) used as a collective (so S. R. Driver, <i>Jeremiah</i>, 368, with cross reference to GKC 462-63 &#167;145.<i>c</i>). J. Bright (<i>Jeremiah</i> [AB], 314, n. e-e) follows a suggestion of D. N. Freedman in seeing the form (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1460;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1462;&#1497;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">tihyenah</font>) as a mistake for the 2nd masculine plural plus energic (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1460;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;</font>, <font face="Scholar">tihyun</font>). Given the number of other textual corruptions in this passage, this is possible. The resultant meaning in either case is the same.<br /></span></span>   </span>

Of the five words two are extremely problematic and the meaning of the second affects also the meaning of the last word which normally means &#8220;go out.&#8221; The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1460;&#1497;&#1509;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsits</font>) regularly refers to a blossom or flower or the diadem on the front of Aaron&#8217;s mitre. BDB 851 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1460;&#1497;&#1509;</font> gives a nuance &#8220;wings (coll)&#8221; based on the interpretation of Abu Walid and some medieval Jewish interpreters who related it to an Aramaic root. But BDB says that meaning is dubious and refers to the Greek which reads <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#963;&#951;&#956;&#949;&#8150;&#945;</font> (<font face="Greektl">shmeia</font>, &#8220;sign&#8221; or &#8220;sign post&#8221;). Along with KBL 802 s.v. I <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1460;&#1497;&#1509;</font> and <i>HALOT</i> 959 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1460;&#1497;&#1509;</font>, BDB suggests that the Greek presupposes the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsiyyun</font>) which refers to a road marker (<ref id="19713">Jer 31:21</ref>) or a gravestone (<ref id="10183">2 Kgs 23:17</ref>). That is the meaning followed here. Several modern commentaries and English versions have followed a proposal by W. Moran that the word is related to a Ugaritic word meaning salt (cf., e.g., J. Bright, <i>Jeremiah</i> [AB], 320). However, <i>HALOT</i> 959 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1460;&#1497;&#1509;</font> questions the validity of this on philological grounds saying that the meaning of salt does not really fit the Ugaritic either. The present translation follows the suggestions of the lexicons here and reads the word as though the Greek supported the meaning &#8220;gravestone.&#8221; The other difficulty is with the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1510;&#1465;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">natso</font>&#8217;), which looks like a Qal infinitive absolute of an otherwise unattested root which BDB s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1488;</font> says is defined in Gesenius&#8217; Thesaurus as &#8220;fly.&#8221; However, see the meaning and the construction of an infinitive absolute of one root with that of another as highly improbable. Hence, most modern lexicons either emend the forms to read <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1510;&#1465;&#1492; &#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1510;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">natsoh titseh</font>) from the root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">natsah</font>) meaning &#8220;to fall into ruins&#8221; (so KBL 629 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1492;</font> Qal, and see among others J.

This is the option that this translation as well as a number of modern ones have taken. A second option is to see <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1510;&#1465;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">natso</font>&#8217;) as an error for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1510;&#1465;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yatso</font>&#8217;) and read the text in the sense of &#8220;she will certainly surrender,&#8221; a meaning that the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yatsa</font>&#8217;) has in <ref id="7449">1 Sam 11:3</ref>; <ref id="18337">Isa 36:6</ref>.

He points to the fact that the &#8220;I&#8221; in <ref id="20114">vv. 33</ref>, 35, 38 can only refer to God.

The ambiguity of the syntax and the apparent elliptical nature of this text makes the meaning of this verse uncertain. The Hebrew text reads: &#8220;From the cry of Heshbon unto Elealeh unto Jahaz they utter their voice from Zoar unto Horonaim Eglath Shelishiyah.&#8221; The translation and interpretation here are based on interpreting the elliptical syntax here by the parallel passage in <ref id="17965-17967">Isaiah 15:4-6</ref> where cries of anguish rise from Heshbon and Elealeh which are heard all the way to Jahaz. The people flee southward arriving at Zoar and Eglath Shelishiyah where they voice the news of the destruction in the north. Hence, the present translation interprets the phrase &#8220;from the cry of Heshbon unto Elealeh&#8221; to be parallel to &#8220;Heshbon and Elealeh cry out&#8221; and take the preposition &#8220;from&#8221; with the verb &#8220;they utter their voice,&#8221; i.e., with the cry of Heshbon and Elealeh. The impersonal &#8220;they raise their voice&#8221; is then treated as a passive and made the subject of the whole verse. There is some debate about the identification of the waters of Nimrim. They may refer to the waters of the Wadi Nimrim which enters the Jordan about eight miles north of the Dead Sea or those of the Wadi en-Numeirah which flows into the southern tip of the Dead Sea from about ten miles south. Most commentators take the reference to be the latter because of association with Zoar. However, if the passage is talking about the destruction in the north which is reported in the south by the fleeing refugees, the reference is probably to the Wadi Nimrim in the north.<br /><br/></br><b>sn</b> <i>Elealeh</i> was about two miles (3.3 km) north of Heshbon. Jahaz was about twenty miles (33 km) south of it. These three cities were in the north and <i>Zoar</i>, <i>Horonaim</i>, and <i>Eglath Shelishiyah</i> were apparently in the south. The verse is speaking about the news of destruction in the north spreading to the south.

They will burn up the mountain heights of those war-loving people.&#8221; The meaning of this verse is not entirely certain because of the highly figurative nature of the last two lines. The Hebrew text has been translated somewhat literally here. The Hebrew text reads: &#8220;In the shadow of Heshbon those fleeing stand without strength. For a fire goes forth from Heshbon, a flame from the midst of Sihon. And it devours the forehead of Moab and the skull of the sons of noise.&#8221; The meaning of the first part is fairly clear because <ref id="20083">v. 2</ref> has already spoken of the conquest of Heshbon and a plot formed there to conquer the rest of the nation. The fire going forth from Heshbon would hence refer here to the conflagrations of war spreading from Heshbon to the rest of the country. The reference to the &#8220;midst of Sihon&#8221; is to be understood metonymically as a reference for the ruler to what he once ruled (cf. E. W. Bullinger, <i>Figures of Speech</i>, 583). The last two lines must refer to more than the fugitives who stopped at Heshbon for protection because it refers to the forehead of Moab (a personification of the whole land or nation). It is unclear, however, why reference is made to the foreheads and skulls of the Moabites, other than the fact that this verse seems to be a readaptation or reuse of <ref id="4464">Num 24:17</ref> where the verb used with them is &#8220;smite&#8221; which fits nicely in the sense of martial destruction. Translated rather literally, it appears here to refer to the destruction by the fires of war of the Moabites, the part (forehead and skulls) put for the whole. TEV sees a reference here to the &#8220;frontiers&#8221; and &#8220;mountain heights&#8221; of Moab and this would work nicely for &#8220;foreheads&#8221; which is elsewhere used of the corner or border of a land in <ref id="12534">Neh 9:22</ref>. The word &#8220;crown&#8221; or &#8220;skull&#8221; might be a picturesque metaphor for the mountain heights of a land, but the word is never used elsewhere in such a figurative way. TEV (and CEV) which follows it might be correct here but there is no way to validate it. The meaning &#8220;war-loving people&#8221; for the phrase &#8220;sons of noise&#8221; is based on the suggestion of BDB 981 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> 1 which relates the phrase to the dominant use for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">on</font>) and is adopted also by TEV, CEV, and C. von Orelli, <i>Jeremiah</i>, 341. REB &#8220;braggarts&#8221; and NIV &#8220;noisy boasters&#8221; seem to base the nuance on the usage of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">on</font>) in <ref id="20063">Jer 46:17</ref> where Pharaoh is referred to as an empty noise and the reference to Moab&#8217;s arrogance and boasting in <ref id="20110">48:29</ref>.<br /><br/></br><b>sn</b> This verse and the next are an apparent adaptation and reuse of a victory song in <ref id="4369-4370">Num 21:28-29</ref> and a prophecy in <ref id="4464">Num 24:17</ref>. That explains the reference to Sihon who was the Amorite king who captured Heshbon and proceeded from there to capture most of northern Moab (the area between Heshbon and the Arnon) which has been referred to earlier in this prophecy. This prophecy appears to speak of the destruction of Moab beginning from the same place under the picture of a destructive fire which burns up all the people. The fire is a reference to the conflagrations of war in which the enemy captures the cities and sets them on fire and burns all the people in them. What Sihon once did (<ref id="4369-4370">Num 21:28-29</ref>) and what Balaam prophesied would happen to Moab in the future (by David? <ref id="4464">Num 24:17</ref>) are being reapplied to a new situation.<br /></span></span>   </span>

He describes the miserable existence of the wicked, indicating that it is the proof of sin. His speech falls into two main parts: why is Job so contemptuous toward his friends (<ref id="13279-13281">Job 18:2-4</ref>), and the fate of the wicked (<ref id="13282-13298">18:5-21</ref>).

But a plural of &#8220;end&#8221; is not found in the OT. Some will link the word to Arabic <i>qanasa</i>, &#8220;to hunt; to give chase,&#8221; to get an interpretation of &#8220;snares for words.&#8221; But E. Dhorme (<i>Job</i>, 257) objects that this does not fit the speech of Bildad (as well as it might Job&#8217;s). He finds a cognate <i>qinsu</i>, &#8220;fetters, shackles,&#8221; and reads &#8220;how long will you put shackles on words.&#8221; But G. R. Driver had pointed out that this cognate does not exist (&#8220;Problems in the Hebrew text of Job,&#8221; VTSup 3 [1955]: 72-93). So it would be preferable to take the reading &#8220;ends&#8221; and explain the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nun</font>) as from a Aramaizing by-form. This is supported by 11QtgJob that uses <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1493;&#1465;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">sof</font>, &#8220;end&#8221;). On the construction, GKC 421 &#167;130.<i>a</i> explains this as a use of the construct in rapid narrative to connect the words; in such cases a preposition is on the following noun.<br /></span></span>   and then<span class="note"><span class="key">4</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The imperfect verb, again plural, would be here taken in the nuance of instruction, or a modal nuance of obligation.

The problem is that the form is either a third feminine (Rashi thought it was referring to Job&#8217;s wife) or the second person. There is a good deal of debate over the possibility of the prefix <i>t-</i> being a variant for the third masculine form. The evidence in Ugaritic and Akkadian is mixed, stronger for the plural than the singular. Gesenius has some samples where the third feminine form might also be used for the passive if there is no expressed subject (see GKC 459 &#167;144.<i>b</i>), but the evidence is not strong. The simplest choices are to change the prefix to a <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yod</font>), or argue that the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tav</font>) can be masculine, or follow Gesenius.<br /></span></span>   of <span class="w H1091" data-lemma="H1091">terrors</span>.  </span>

The verb, again a third feminine form, says &#8220;it dwells in his tent.&#8221; But the next part (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497; &#1500;&#1493;&#1465;</font>, <font face="Scholar">mibb&#255;li lo</font>) means something like &#8220;things of what are not his.&#8221; The best that can be made of the MT is &#8220;There shall live in his tent they that are not his&#8221; (referring to persons and animals; see J.

Dahood suggested a reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mabbel</font>) and a connection to Akkadian <i>nablu</i>, &#8220;fire&#8221; (cf.

The interchange of <i>m</i> and <i>n</i> is not a problem, and the parallelism with the next line makes good sense (&#8220;Some Northwest Semitic words in Job,&#8221; <i>Bib</i> 38 [1957]: 312ff.). Others suggest an emendation to get &#8220;night-hag&#8221; or vampire. This suggestion, as well as Driver&#8217;s &#8220;mixed herbs,&#8221; are linked to the idea of exorcism. But if a change is to be made, Dahood&#8217;s is the most compelling.<br /></span></span>   </span>

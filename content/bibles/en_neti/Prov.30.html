It is usually followed by the subjective genitive: &#8220;the oracle of this man to Ithiel.&#8221;<br /></span></span>   to <span class="w H384" data-lemma="H384">Ithiel</span>,  to <span class="w H384" data-lemma="H384">Ithiel</span> and to <span class="w H401" data-lemma="H401">Ukal:</span><span class="note"><span class="key">5</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> There have been numerous attempts to reinterpret the first two verses of the chapter. The Greek version translated the names &#8220;Ithiel&#8221; and &#8220;Ukal,&#8221; resulting in &#8220;I am weary, O God, I am weary and faint&#8221; (C. C. Torrey, &#8220;Proverbs Chapter 30,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 73 [1954]: 93-96). The LXX&#8217;s approach is followed by some English versions (e.g., NRSV, NLT). The Midrash tried through a clever etymologizing translation to attribute the works to Solomon (explained by W. G. Plaut, <i>Proverbs</i>, 299). It is most likely that someone other than Solomon wrote these sayings; they have a different, almost non-proverbial, tone to them. See P. Franklyn, &#8220;The Sayings of Agur in Proverbs 30: Piety or Skepticism,&#8221; <i>ZAW</i> 95 (1983): 239-52.<br /></span></span>   </span>

However, NRSV takes the plural as a reference to the &#8220;holy ones,&#8221; presumably referring to angelic beings.<br /></span></span>    </span>

These questions display mankind&#8217;s limitations and God&#8217;s incomparable nature. The first question could be open to include humans, but may refer to God alone (as the other questions do).<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H4310" data-lemma="H4310">Who</span> has <span class="w H622" data-lemma="H622">gathered up</span> the <span class="w H7307" data-lemma="H7307">winds</span> in his <span class="w H2651" data-lemma="H2651">fists</span>?<span class="note"><span class="key">13</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> The questions are filled with anthropomorphic language.

Parallels with Ugaritic are interesting, because Baal is referred to as a son; but that is bound up within the pantheon where there was a father god. Some of the Jewish commentators exhibit a strange logic in expressing what Christians would say is only their blindness to the full revelation: There is little cogency in this being a reference to Jesus because if there had been such a person at any time in the past he would have left some tradition about it through his descendants (J. H. Greenstone, <i>Proverbs</i>, 317). But Judaism has taught from the earliest times that Messiah was preexistent (especially in view of Micah 5 and Daniel 7); and the claims of Jesus in the Gospels bear this out. It seems best to say that there is a hint here of the nature of the Messiah as Son, a hint that will later be revealed in full through the incarnation.<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H3588" data-lemma="H3588">if</span> you <span class="w H3045" data-lemma="H3045">know!</span> </span>

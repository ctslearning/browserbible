<h3>The Creation of Man and Woman</h3>

<span class="verse Gen_2_4" data-osis="Gen.2.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="w H428" data-lemma="H428">This</span> is the <span class="w H8435" data-lemma="H8435">account</span><span class="note"><span class="key">9</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The Hebrew phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492; &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1456;&#1491;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elle tol&#255;dot</font>) is traditionally translated as &#8220;these are the generations of&#8221; because the noun was derived from the verb &#8220;beget.&#8221; Its usage, however, shows that it introduces more than genealogies; it begins a narrative that traces what became of the entity or individual mentioned in the heading. In fact, a good paraphrase of this heading would be: &#8220;This is what became of the heavens and the earth,&#8221; for what follows is not another account of creation but a tracing of events from creation through the fall and judgment (the section extends from <ref id="35">2:4</ref> through <ref id="106">4:26</ref>). See M. H. Woudstra, &#8220;The <i>Toledot</i> of the Book of Genesis and Their Redemptive-Historical Significance,&#8221; <i>CTJ</i> 5 (1970): 184-89.<br /><br/></br><b>sn</b> The expression <i>this is the account of</i> is an important title used throughout the Book of Genesis, serving as the organizing principle of the work. It is always a heading, introducing the subject matter that is to come. From the starting point of the title, the narrative traces the genealogy or the records or the particulars involved. Although some would make the heading in <ref id="35">2:4</ref> a summary of creation (1:1&#8211;2:3), that goes against the usage in the book. As a heading it introduces the theme of the next section, the particulars about this creation that God made. Genesis 2 is not a simple parallel account of creation; rather, beginning with the account of the creation of man and women, the narrative tells what became of that creation. As a beginning, the construction of <ref id="35-38">2:4-7</ref> forms a fine parallel to the construction of <ref id="1-3">1:1-3</ref>. The subject matter of each <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1456;&#1491;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tol&#255;dot</font>, &#8220;this is the account of&#8221;) section of the book traces a decline or a deterioration through to the next beginning point, and each is thereby a microcosm of the book which begins with divine blessing in the garden, and ends with a coffin in Egypt. So, what became of the creation? Gen 2:4&#8211;4:26 will explain that sin entered the world and all but destroyed God&#8217;s perfect creation.<br /></span></span>   of the <span class="w H8064" data-lemma="H8064">heavens</span> and the <span class="w H776" data-lemma="H776">earth</span><span class="note"><span class="key">10</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> See the note on the phrase &#8220;the heavens and the earth&#8221; in <ref id="1">1:1</ref>.<br /><br/></br><b>sn</b> This is the only use of the Hebrew noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1456;&#1491;&#1465;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tol&#255;dot</font>) in the book that is not followed by a personal name (e.g., &#8220;this is the account of Isaac&#8221;). The poetic parallelism reveals that even though the account may be about the creation, it is the creation the <sc>Lord</sc> God made.<br /></span></span>   when they were <span class="w H1254" data-lemma="H1254">created</span>–  <span class="w H3117" data-lemma="H3117">when</span> the <span class="w H3068" data-lemma="H3068">Lord</span> <span class="w H430" data-lemma="H430">God</span><span class="note"><span class="key">11</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> Advocates of the so-called documentary hypothesis of pentateuchal authorship argue that the introduction of the name Yahweh (<sc>Lord</sc>) here indicates that a new source (designated J), a parallel account of creation, begins here. In this scheme <ref id="1-34">Gen 1:1-2:3</ref> is understood as the priestly source (designated P) of creation. Critics of this approach often respond that the names, rather than indicating separate sources, were chosen to reflect the subject matter (see U. Cassuto, <i>The Documentary Hypothesis</i>). Gen 1:1&#8211;2:3 is the grand prologue of the book, showing the sovereign God creating by decree. The narrative beginning in 2:4 is the account of what this God invested in his creation. Since it deals with the close, personal involvement of the covenant God, the narrative uses the covenantal name Yahweh (<sc>Lord</sc>) in combination with the name God. For a recent discussion of the documentary hypothesis from a theologically conservative perspective, see D. A. Garrett, <i>Rethinking Genesis</i>. For an attempt by source critics to demonstrate the legitimacy of the source critical method on the basis of ancient Near Eastern parallels, see J. H. Tigay, ed., <i>Empirical Models for Biblical Criticism</i>. For reaction to the source critical method by literary critics, see I. M. Kikawada and A. Quinn, <i>Before Abraham Was</i>; R. Alter, <i>The Art of Biblical Narrative</i>, 131-54; and Adele Berlin, <i>Poetics and Interpretation of Biblical Narrative</i>, 111-34.<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H6213" data-lemma="H6213">made</span> the <span class="w H776" data-lemma="H776">earth</span> and <span class="w H8064" data-lemma="H8064">heavens</span>.<span class="note"><span class="key">12</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> See the note on the phrase &#8220;the heavens and the earth&#8221; in <ref id="1">1:1</ref>; the order here is reversed, but the meaning is the same.<br /></span></span>   </span>

See E. O. James, <i>The Tree of Life</i> (SHR); and R.

For a survey of opinions, see G. J. Wenham, <i>Genesis</i> (WBC), <ref id="1-1">1:62-64</ref>. One view is that &#8220;good&#8221; refers to that which enhances, promotes, and produces life, while &#8220;evil&#8221; refers to anything that hinders, interrupts or destroys life. So eating from this tree would change human nature &#8211; people would be able to alter life for better (in their thinking) or for worse. See D. J. A. Clines, &#8220;The Tree of Knowledge and the Law of Yahweh,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 24 (1974): 8-14; and I. Engnell, &#8220;&#8216;Knowledge&#8217; and &#8216;Life&#8217; in the Creation Story,&#8221; <i>Wisdom in Israel and in the Ancient Near East</i> [VTSup], 103-19. Another view understands the &#8220;knowledge of good and evil&#8221; as the capacity to discern between moral good and evil. The following context suggests the tree&#8217;s fruit gives one wisdom (see the phrase &#8220;capable of making one wise&#8221; in <ref id="62">3:6</ref>, as well as the note there on the word &#8220;wise&#8221;), which certainly includes the capacity to discern between good and evil. Such wisdom is characteristic of divine beings, as the serpent&#8217;s promise implies (<ref id="61">3:5</ref>) and as <ref id="78">3:22</ref> makes clear. (Note, however, that this capacity does not include the ability to <i>do</i> what is right.) God prohibits man from eating of the tree. The prohibition becomes a test to see if man will be satisfied with his role and place, or if he will try to ascend to the divine level. There will be a time for man to possess moral discernment/wisdom, as God reveals and imparts it to him, but it is not something to be grasped at in an effort to become &#8220;a god.&#8221; In fact, the command to be obedient was the first lesson in moral discernment/wisdom. God was essentially saying: &#8220;Here is lesson one &#8211; respect my authority and commands. Disobey me and you will die.&#8221; When man disobeys, he decides he does not want to acquire moral wisdom God&#8217;s way, but instead tries to rise immediately to the divine level. Once man has acquired such divine wisdom by eating the tree&#8217;s fruit (<ref id="78">3:22</ref>), he must be banned from the garden so that he will not be able to achieve his goal of being godlike and thus live forever, a divine characteristic (<ref id="80">3:24</ref>). Ironically, man now has the capacity to discern good from evil (<ref id="78">3:22</ref>), but he is morally corrupted and rebellious and will not consistently choose what is right.<br /></span></span>   were in the <span class="w H8432" data-lemma="H8432">middle</span> of the <span class="w H1588" data-lemma="H1588">orchard</span>.)  </span>

The construction simply emphasizes the certainty of death, however it is defined. Death is essentially separation. To die physically means separation from the land of the living, but not extinction. To die spiritually means to be separated from God. Both occur with sin, although the physical alienation is more gradual than instant, and the spiritual is immediate, although the effects of it continue the separation.<br /></span></span>   </span>

In this context the word seems to express the idea of an &#8220;indispensable companion.&#8221; The woman would supply what the man was lacking in the design of creation and logically it would follow that the man would supply what she was lacking, although that is not stated here. See further M. L. Rosenzweig, &#8220;A Helper Equal to Him,&#8221; <i>Jud</i> 139 (1986): 277-80.<br /></span></span>  for him  who <span class="w H5048" data-lemma="H5048">corresponds to him</span>.”<span class="note"><span class="key">57</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The Hebrew expression <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1462;&#1490;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;</font> (<font face="Scholar">k&#255;negdo</font>) literally means &#8220;according to the opposite of him.&#8221; Translations such as &#8220;suitable [for]&#8221; (NASB, NIV), &#8220;matching,&#8221; &#8220;corresponding to&#8221; all capture the idea. (Translations that render the phrase simply &#8220;partner&#8221; [cf. NEB, NRSV], while not totally inaccurate, do not reflect the nuance of correspondence and/or suitability.) The man&#8217;s form and nature are matched by the woman&#8217;s as she reflects him and complements him. Together they correspond. In short, this prepositional phrase indicates that she has everything that God had invested in him.<br /></span></span>   </span>

Naming can indicate ownership or authority if one is calling someone or something <i>by</i> one&#8217;s name and/or calling a name <i>over</i> someone or something (see <ref id="8315">2 Sam 12:28</ref>; <ref id="11339">2 Chr 7:14</ref>; <ref id="17735">Isa 4:1</ref>; <ref id="19134, 19332">Jer 7:14; 15:16</ref>), especially if one is conquering and renaming a site.

In each case where it is used, the one naming discerns something about the object being named and gives it an appropriate name (See <ref id="7401">1 Sam 9:9</ref>; <ref id="8497">2 Sam 18:18</ref>; <ref id="16862">Prov 16:21</ref>; <ref id="17681, 18265, 18329, 18859, 18867">Isa 1:26; 32:5; 35:8; 62:4, 12</ref>; <ref id="19414">Jer 19:6</ref>). Adam is not so much naming the woman as he is discerning her close relationship to him and referring to her accordingly. He may simply be anticipating that she will be given an appropriate name based on the discernible similarity.<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H802" data-lemma="H802">‘woman</span>,’  <span class="w H3588" data-lemma="H3588">for</span> she was <span class="w H3947" data-lemma="H3947">taken out</span> of<span class="note"><span class="key">69</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;from&#8221; (but see <ref id="53">v. 22</ref>).<br /></span></span> <span class="w H376" data-lemma="H376">man</span>.”<span class="note"><span class="key">70</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> This poetic section expresses the correspondence between the man and the woman.

The retention of the word &#8220;flesh&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">basar</font>) in the translation often leads to improper or incomplete interpretations. The Hebrew word refers to more than just a sexual union. When they unite in marriage, the man and woman bring into being a new family unit (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1492;</font> + <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;</font>, <font face="Scholar">hayah</font> + <font face="Scholar">lamed</font> preposition means &#8220;become&#8221;). The phrase &#8220;one flesh&#8221; occurs only here and must be interpreted in light of <ref id="54">v. 23</ref>. There the man declares that the woman is bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh. To be one&#8217;s &#8220;bone and flesh&#8221; is to be related by blood to someone. For example, the phrase describes the relationship between Laban and Jacob (<ref id="810">Gen 29:14</ref>); Abimelech and the Shechemites (<ref id="6757">Judg 9:2</ref>; his mother was a Shechemite); David and the Israelites (<ref id="8134">2 Sam 5:1</ref>); David and the elders of Judah (<ref id="8524">2 Sam 19:12</ref>); and David and his nephew Amasa (<ref id="8525">2 Sam 19:13</ref>, see <ref id="8452">2 Sam 17:2</ref>; <ref id="10323-10324">1 Chr 2:16-17</ref>). The expression &#8220;one flesh&#8221; seems to indicate that they become, as it were, &#8220;kin,&#8221; at least legally (a new family unit is created) or metaphorically. In this first marriage in human history, the woman was literally formed from the man&#8217;s bone and flesh. Even though later marriages do not involve such a divine surgical operation, the first marriage sets the pattern for how later marriages are understood and explains why marriage supersedes the parent-child relationship.<br /></span></span>   </span>

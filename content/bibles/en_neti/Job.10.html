Most commentators follow the LXX and connect the first two words with the second colon as the MT accents indicate (NJPS, &#8220;then destroyed every part of me&#8221;), rather than with the first colon (&#8220;and made me complete,&#8221; J. E. Hartley, <i>Job</i> [NICOT], 185). Instead of &#8220;together&#8221; some read &#8220;after.&#8221; Others see in <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1505;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1489;</font> (<font face="Scholar">saviv</font>) not so much an adjectival use but a verbal or adverbial use: &#8220;you turn and destroy&#8221; or &#8220;you destroy utterly (all around).&#8221; This makes more sense than &#8220;turn.&#8221; In addition, the verb form in the line is the preterite with <i>vav</i> consecutive; this may be another example of the transposition of the copula (see <ref id="12937">4:6</ref>). For yet another option (&#8220;You have engulfed me about altogether&#8221;), see R. Fuller, &#8220;<ref id="2100">Exodus 21:22</ref>: The Miscarriage Interpretation and the Personhood of the Fetus,&#8221; <i>JETS</i> 37 (1994): 178.<br /></span></span>   </span>

The NIV gets around the problem with a different meaning for the verb: &#8220;you molded me like clay.&#8221; Some suggest the meaning was &#8220;as [with] clay&#8221; (in the same manner that we have &#8220;as [in] the day of Midian&#8221; [<ref id="17834">Isa 9:4</ref>]).<br /></span></span>   the <span class="w H2563" data-lemma="H2563">clay;</span> will<span class="note"><span class="key">24</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The text has a conjunction: &#8220;and to dust&#8230;.&#8221;<br /></span></span>  you <span class="w H7725" data-lemma="H7725">return</span> me to <span class="w H6083" data-lemma="H6083">dust</span>?  </span>

This could then be interpreted adjectivally and parallel to the preceding line: &#8220;steeped/saturated with affliction.&#8221; This would also delete the final <i>yod</i> as dittography (E. Dhorme, <i>Job</i>, 152). But D. J. A. Clines notes more recent interpretations that suggest the form in the text is an orthographic variant of <i>raweh</i> meaning &#8220;satiated.&#8221; This makes any emendation unnecessary (and in fact that idea of &#8220;steeped&#8221; was not helpful any way because it indicated imbibing rather than soaking). The NIV renders it &#8220;and drowned in my affliction&#8221; although footnoting the other possibility from the MT, &#8220;aware of my affliction&#8221; (assuming the form could be adjectival). The LXX omits the last line.<br /></span></span>   </span>

It appears that Job is talking about himself in some way. Some commentators simply emend the text to make it first person. This has the support of Targum Job, which would be expected since it would be interpreting the passage in its context (see D. M. Stec, &#8220;The Targum Rendering of WYG&#8217;H in Job X 16,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 34 [1984]: 367-8). Pope and Gordis make the word adjectival, modifying the subject: &#8220;proudly you hunt me,&#8221; but support is lacking. E. Dhorme thinks the line should be parallel to the two preceding it, and so suggests <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1490;&#1468;&#1461;&#1506;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yagea</font>&#8217;, &#8220;exhausted&#8221;) for <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1490;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yig</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">eh</font>, &#8220;lift up&#8221;). The contextual argument is that Job has said that he cannot raise his head, but if he were to do so, God would hunt him down. God could be taken as the subject of the verb if the text is using enallage (shifting of grammatical persons within a discourse) for dramatic effect. Perhaps the initial 3rd person was intended with respect within a legal context of witnesses and a complaint, but was switched to 2nd person for direct accusation.<br /></span></span>   you <span class="w H6679" data-lemma="H6679">hunt</span> me as a <span class="w H7826" data-lemma="H7826">fierce lion</span>,<span class="note"><span class="key">42</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> There is some ambiguity here: Job could be the lion being hunted by God, or God could be hunting Job like a lion hunts its prey.

Here in this stem it has the sense of &#8220;make oneself admirable, surpassing&#8221; or &#8220;render oneself powerful, glorious.&#8221; The text is ironic; the word that described God&#8217;s marvelous creation of Job is here used to describe God&#8217;s awesome destruction of Job.<br /></span></span>   against me. </span>

Because the name <i>Gaius</i> was very common in the Roman Empire, it is highly unlikely that the person named here is to be identified with any of the others of the same name associated with Paul (<ref id="28378">1 Cor 1:14</ref>; <ref id="28360">Rom 16:23</ref> [these two references are probably to the same person]; <ref id="27615">Acts 19:29</ref>; <ref id="27631">Acts 20:4</ref>). A 4th century tradition recorded in the <i>Apostolic Constitutions</i> 7.46.9 (ca. <sc>a.d.</sc> 370) states that John the Apostle ordained Gaius as bishop of Pergamum, but this is questionable because of the relatively late date. The only certain information about this individual must be obtained from 3 John itself, and there is not a great deal there. It is obvious that this person is well known to the author, but it is not so certain whether they had met personally or not, because the report of Gaius&#8217; conduct toward the brothers is received secondhand by the author (<ref id="30662">v. 3</ref>). Nor can it be determined with certainty whether Gaius belonged to the same local church as Diotrephes (<ref id="30668">v. 9</ref>), or was himself the leader of another local congregation. It is clear that the author regarded him as orthodox (<ref id="30662">v. 3</ref>) and a valuable ally in the controversy with the secessionist opponents and their false Christology discussed at length in 1 John.<br /></span></span>   my <span class="w G27" data-lemma="G27" data-morph="A-DSM">dear brother</span>,  <span class="w G3739" data-lemma="G3739" data-morph="R-ASM">whom</span> <span class="w G1473" data-lemma="G1473" data-morph="P-1NS">I</span> <span class="w G25" data-lemma="G25" data-morph="V-PAI-1S-C">love</span> <span class="w G1722" data-lemma="G1722" data-morph="PREP">in</span> <span class="w G225" data-lemma="G225" data-morph="N-DSF">truth</span>.<span class="note"><span class="key">4</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The prepositional phrase <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#957; &#7936;&#955;&#951;&#952;&#949;&#943;&#8115;</font> (<font face="Greektl">en alhqeia</font>) in 3 John 1 is similar to 2 John 1, although it is not qualified here as it is there (see 2 John 1). This is not merely the equivalent of an adverb (&#8220;truly&#8221;), but is a theological statement affirming the orthodoxy of Gaius, to whom the letter is addressed. &#8220;Truth&#8221; is the author&#8217;s way of alluding to theological orthodoxy in the face of the challenge by the opponents (see <ref id="30599">1 John 3:19</ref>).<br /></span></span>   </span>

In <ref id="26506">John 10:24</ref> and <ref id="26608">12:27</ref> the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#968;&#965;&#967;&#8053;</font> is that part of a person where emotions are experienced; one&#8217;s <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#968;&#965;&#967;&#8053;</font> is held in suspense or deeply troubled. This is, in other words, the immaterial part of a person as opposed to his physical existence. A close parallel is found in Philo, <i>Heir</i> 58 (285): &#8220;nourished with peace, he will depart, having gained a calm, unclouded life&#8230;welfare in the body, welfare in the soul (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#968;&#965;&#967;&#8053;</font>)&#8230;health and strength&#8230;delight in virtues.&#8221;<br /><b>sn</b> <i>Just as it is well with your soul.</i> The equivalent contemporary idiom would be to speak of &#8216;spiritual&#8217; health as opposed to physical health. The author affirms that Gaius is indeed well off spiritually, and he prays that Gaius&#8217; physical health would match his spiritual health, i.e., that Gaius would be as well off physically as he is spiritually. It is the spiritual health which is to be the standard by which one&#8217;s physical health is measured, not the other way round.<br /></span></span>   </span>

<h3>The Charge to Gaius</h3>

Since the suggestion in 3 John 3 is that the &#8220;<i>brothers</i>&#8221; have come and testified in the author&#8217;s church about what Gaius has done for them, it seems most likely that the &#8220;<i>church</i>&#8221; mentioned here is also the author&#8217;s church, where he is currently located.

Apparently the missionaries are on their way to visit the area where Gaius&#8217; church is located a second time. They had been there once already and had returned with a good report of how Gaius had assisted them. It is entirely possible that they themselves carry with them the present letter as a letter of introduction. Along these lines it has been suggested that <i>Demetrius</i> (see 3 John 12) is one of these traveling missionaries, perhaps the leader of the delegation, and the author is formally introducing him to Gaius, since when he was there the last time he was a <i>stranger</i> (<ref id="30664">v. 5</ref>) but Gaius assisted him anyway.<br /></span></span>   </span>

This verb is used of Paul&#8217;s travels in <ref id="27435">Acts 14:20</ref>, and of his setting out on his second missionary journey in <ref id="27483">Acts 15:40</ref>.<br /></span></span>   <span class="w G5228" data-lemma="G5228" data-morph="PREP">on behalf</span> of “The <span class="w G3686" data-lemma="G3686" data-morph="N-GSN">Name</span>,”<span class="note"><span class="key">15</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> Three possibilities for the identification of <i>&#8216;The Name&#8217;</i> have been suggested: (1) the name of God, suggested by the unqualified noun with the Greek article. In Rabbinic literature &#8220;the Name&#8221; is a frequent substitute for the Tetragrammaton YHWH, the name of God, which was too sacred to be pronounced. This would make good logical sense in 3 John, because in the previous verse the author has instructed Gaius to send the missionaries on their way &#8220;in a manner worthy of God.&#8221; (2) Some have understood &#8220;the Name&#8221; as the self-designation of the Johannine community, or as a reference to the Christian cause at large, or as a way of designating Christians before the title &#8220;Christian&#8221; came into common usage. (3) The interpretation favored by most commentators is that this is a reference to Jesus&#8217; name. Paul uses a similar phrase in <ref id="27936">Rom 1:5</ref>, and in <ref id="30563">1 John 2:12</ref> the author wrote, &#8220;your sins are forgiven on account of His (Christ&#8217;s) name.&#8221; John&#8217;s Gospel also makes reference to believing &#8220;in the name of Jesus&#8221; (<ref id="26057, 26139">John 1:12; 3:18</ref>).<br /></span></span>   <span class="w G2983" data-lemma="G2983" data-morph="V-PAP-NPM">accepting</span> <span class="w G3367" data-lemma="G3367" data-morph="A-ASN">nothing</span> <span class="w G575" data-lemma="G575" data-morph="PREP">from</span> the <span class="w G1482" data-lemma="G1482" data-morph="A-GPM">pagans</span>.<span class="note"><span class="key">16</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#952;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">eqniko&quot;</font>) occurs only 4 times in the NT (the other three are in <ref id="23282, 23290">Matt 5:47; 6:7</ref>; and <ref id="23745">18:17</ref>). It is virtually synonymous here with the far more common <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7956;&#952;&#957;&#959;&#962;</font> (<font face="Greektl">eqno&quot;</font>, used some 162 times in the NT).

There is precedent in the Johannine literature for understanding &#8220;truth&#8221; as personified (<ref id="26414">John 8:32</ref>, &#8220;the truth will make you free&#8221;; possibly also <ref id="30599">1 John 3:19</ref>). More explicitly, <ref id="30610">1 John 4:6</ref> identifies the Holy Spirit as &#8220;the Spirit of Truth,&#8221; a characterization repeated in <ref id="30631">1 John 5:6</ref>. Thus it seems likely that the &#8220;truth&#8221; at work through the missionaries here is ultimately the Holy Spirit, who works through their efforts. The Christian who supports them thus becomes a coworker with the Spirit of God himself.<br /></span></span>   </span>

But what is the relationship of this church in <ref id="30668">v. 9</ref> to Gaius, to whom the letter is addressed? It is sometimes suggested that Gaius belongs to this church, but that seems unlikely, because the author uses a third-person pronoun to refer to the other members of the church (<i>among</i> <i>them</i>). If Gaius were one of these it would have been much more natural to use a second-person pronoun: &#8220;Diotrephes, who loves to be first <i>among</i> <i>you</i>.&#8221; Thus it seems probable that Gaius belongs to (or is in charge of) one local church while Diotrephes is in another, a church known to Gaius but to which he does not belong.<br /></span></span>   <span class="w G235" data-lemma="G235" data-morph="CONJ">but</span> <span class="w G1361" data-lemma="G1361" data-morph="N-NSM">Diotrephes</span>,<span class="note"><span class="key">20</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> <i>Diotrephes</i> appears to be an influential person (perhaps the leader) in a local church known to Gaius, but to which Gaius himself does not belong. The description of Diotrephes as one <i>who loves to be first</i> suggests he is arrogant, and his behavior displays this: He refuses to <i>acknowledge</i> the written communication mentioned by the author at the beginning of <ref id="30668">v. 9</ref> (and thus did not recognize the author&#8217;s apostolic authority), and furthermore (<ref id="30669">v. 10</ref>) <i>refuses</i> to show any hospitality to the traveling missionaries (<i>welcome the brothers</i>) already mentioned by the author. It has been suggested that the description &#8220;loves to be first&#8221; only indicates that Diotrephes sought prominence or position in this church, and had not yet attained any real authority. But his actions here suggest otherwise: He is able to refuse or ignore the author&#8217;s previous written instructions (<ref id="30668">v. 9</ref>), and he is able to have other people put out of the church for showing hospitality to the traveling missionaries (<ref id="30669">v. 10</ref>).<br /></span></span>   who <span class="w G5383" data-lemma="G5383" data-morph="V-PAP-NSM">loves to be first</span> among <span class="w G846" data-lemma="G846" data-morph="P-GPF">them</span>,  <span class="w G1926" data-lemma="G1926" data-morph="V-PNI-3S">does</span> <span class="w G3756" data-lemma="G3756" data-morph="PRT-N">not</span> <span class="w G1926" data-lemma="G1926" data-morph="V-PNI-3S">acknowledge</span> <span class="w G2248" data-lemma="G2248" data-morph="P-1AP">us</span>.<span class="note"><span class="key">21</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> Since the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#948;&#941;&#967;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#953;</font> (<font face="Greektl">epidecomai</font>) can mean &#8220;receive into one&#8217;s presence&#8221; (BDAG 370 s.<ref id="30660">v. 1</ref>; it is used with this meaning in the next verse) it has been suggested that the author himself attempted a previous visit to Diotrephes&#8217; church but was turned away. There is nothing in the context to suggest an unsuccessful prior visit by the author, however; in 3 John 9 he explicitly indicates a prior <i>written</i> communication which Diotrephes apparently ignored or suppressed. The verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Greek">&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#948;&#941;&#967;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#953;</font> can also mean &#8220;accept&#8221; in the sense of &#8220;acknowledge someone&#8217;s authority&#8221; (BDAG 370 s.<ref id="30661">v. 2</ref>) and such a meaning better fits the context here: Diotrephes has not accepted but instead rejected the authority of the author to intervene in the situation of the traveling missionaries (perhaps because Diotrephes believed the author had no local jurisdiction in the matter).<br /></span></span>   </span>

The author exhorts Gaius (whom he wishes to continue assisting the missionaries) not to follow the negative example of Diotrephes, but to do what is right. Implicitly there may be a contrast between the bad behavior of Diotrephes and the good reputation of Demetrius (mentioned in the following verse); but it seems more likely that Demetrius is himself one of the traveling missionaries (perhaps their leader), rather than the leader of a local congregation who, unlike Diotrephes, has supported the missionaries himself.<br /></span></span>   The <span class="w G15" data-lemma="G15" data-morph="V-PAP-NSM">one who does good</span> <span class="w G1510" data-lemma="G1510" data-morph="V-PXI-3S">is</span> <span class="w G1537" data-lemma="G1537" data-morph="PREP">of</span>  <span class="w G2316" data-lemma="G2316" data-morph="N-GSM">God;</span> the <span class="w G2554" data-lemma="G2554" data-morph="V-PAP-NSM">one who does what is bad</span> <span class="w G3708" data-lemma="G3708" data-morph="V-RAI-3S-ATT">has</span> <span class="w G3756" data-lemma="G3756" data-morph="PRT-N">not</span> <span class="w G3708" data-lemma="G3708" data-morph="V-RAI-3S-ATT">seen</span>  <span class="w G2316" data-lemma="G2316" data-morph="N-ASM">God</span>.<span class="note"><span class="key">25</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> The statement <i>The one who does what is bad has not seen God</i> is asyndetic; its abrupt introduction adds emphasis.

By implication, the genuineness of Diotrephes&#8217; faith is called into question, because he has obviously done <i>what is bad</i> (<ref id="30670">v. 11</ref>b; cf. <ref id="30668-30669">vv. 9-10</ref>). In John&#8217;s terminology it is clear that the phrase <i>has not seen God</i> is equivalent to &#8220;is not a genuine Christian&#8221; (see <ref id="26138-26142">John 3:17-21</ref> and <ref id="30586, 30590, 30611, 30624">1 John 3:6, 10; 4:7, 20</ref>).<br /></span></span>   </span>

It is difficult to know more about Demetrius with any certainty, but the author is willing to give him a powerful personal endorsement (<i>We testify to him too</i>). Demetrius may well have been the leader of a delegation of traveling missionaries, and may even have been the bearer of this letter to Gaius.

The author tells Gaius that he has more to say, but does not wish to do so in writing; he would rather talk in person (3 John 14). It appears that the author anticipates a personal visit to Gaius&#8217; church in the very near future. This may be the same visit mentioned in connection with Diotrephes in <ref id="30669">v. 10</ref>. Gaius&#8217; church and Diotrephes&#8217; church may have been in the same city, or in neighboring towns, so that the author anticipates visiting both on the same journey.<br /></span></span>   </span>

The law was inscribed on the tablets of stone by the &#8220;finger&#8221; of God (<ref id="2439, 2455">Exod 31:18; 32:16</ref>). Later under the new covenant it would be written on their hearts (<ref id="19725">Jer 31:33</ref>). Blood was to be applied to the horns of the altar in offering the sin offering (cf., e.g., <ref id="2803, 2814, 2821, 2816">Lev 4:7, 18, 25, 20</ref>) and on the bronze altar to cleanse it from sin on the Day of Atonement (<ref id="3220">Lev 16:18</ref>). Here their sins are engraved (permanently written, cf. <ref id="13322">Job 19:24</ref>) on their hearts (i.e., control their thoughts and actions) and on their altars (permanently polluting them).<br /></span></span>   </span>

The issue is mainly one of vocalization. The versions mentioned are reading a form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1461;&#1512;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mera</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">ah</font>) instead of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1461;&#1512;&#1465;&#1506;&#1462;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">mero</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">eh</font>). There does not appear to be any clear case of a prophet being called a shepherd, especially in Jeremiah where it is invariably used of the wicked leaders/rulers of Judah, the leaders/rulers of the enemy that he brings to punish them, or the righteous ruler that he will bring in the future. Moreover, there are no cases where the preposition &#8220;after&#8221; is used with the verb &#8220;shepherd.&#8221; Parallelism also argues for the appropriateness of this reading; &#8220;disaster&#8221; parallels the &#8220;incurable day.&#8221; The thought also parallels the argument thus far.

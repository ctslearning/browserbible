<h3>The Obedience of Abram</h3>
<p>
<span class="verse Gen_12_1" data-osis="Gen.12.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Now the <span class="w H3068" data-lemma="H3068">Lord</span> <span class="w H559" data-lemma="H559">said</span><span class="note"><span class="key">1</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> The <sc>Lord</sc> called Abram while he was in Ur (see <ref id="368">Gen 15:7</ref>; <ref id="27119">Acts 7:2</ref>); but the sequence here makes it look like it was after the family left to migrate to Canaan (<ref id="298-299">11:31-32</ref>). Genesis records the call of Abram at this place in the narrative because it is the formal beginning of the account of Abram. The record of Terah was brought to its end before this beginning.<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H413" data-lemma="H413">to</span> <span class="w H87" data-lemma="H87">Abram</span>,<span class="note"><span class="key">2</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The call of Abram begins with an imperative <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;&#1470;&#1500;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lekh-l&#255;kha</font>, &#8220;go out&#8221;) followed by three cohortatives (<ref id="301">v. 2</ref>a) indicating purpose or consequence (&#8220;that I may&#8221; or &#8220;then I will&#8221;). If Abram leaves, then God will do these three things. The second imperative (<ref id="301">v. 2</ref>b, literally &#8220;and be a blessing&#8221;) is subordinated to the preceding cohortatives and indicates God&#8217;s ultimate purpose in calling and blessing Abram. On the syntactical structure of <ref id="300-301">vv. 1-2</ref> see R. B. Chisholm, &#8220;Evidence from Genesis,&#8221; <i>A Case for Premillennialism</i>, 37. For a similar sequence of volitive forms see <ref id="1377">Gen 45:18</ref>.<br /><br/></br><b>sn</b> It would be hard to overestimate the value of this call and this divine plan for the theology of the Bible. Here begins God&#8217;s plan to bring redemption to the world. The promises to Abram will be turned into a covenant in Gen 15 and 22 (here it is a call with conditional promises) and will then lead through the Bible to the work of the Messiah.<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H1980" data-lemma="H1980">“Go out</span><span class="note"><span class="key">3</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The initial command is the direct imperative (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</font>, <font face="Scholar">lekh</font>) from the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">halakh</font>). It is followed by the <i>lamed</i> preposition with a pronominal suffix (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;</font>, <font face="Scholar">l&#255;kha</font>) emphasizing the subject of the imperative: &#8220;<i>you</i> leave.&#8221;<br /></span></span>   from your <span class="w H776" data-lemma="H776">country</span>,  your <span class="w H4138" data-lemma="H4138">relatives</span>,  and your <span class="w H1" data-lemma="H1">father’s</span> <span class="w H1004" data-lemma="H1004">household</span> <span class="w H413" data-lemma="H413">to</span> the <span class="w H776" data-lemma="H776">land</span> <span class="w H834" data-lemma="H834">that</span> I will <span class="w H7200" data-lemma="H7200">show</span> you.<span class="note"><span class="key">4</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> <i>To the land that I will show you</i>. The call of Abram illustrates the leading of the <sc>Lord</sc>. The command is to leave. The <sc>Lord</sc>&#8217;s word is very specific about what Abram is to leave (the three prepositional phrases narrow to his father&#8217;s household), but is not specific at all about where he is to go. God required faith, a point that <ref id="30181">Heb 11:8</ref> notes.<br /></span></span> </span>
<span class="verse Gen_12_2" data-osis="Gen.12.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Then I will <span class="w H6213" data-lemma="H6213">make</span> you<span class="note"><span class="key">5</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The three first person verbs in <ref id="301">v. 2</ref>a should be classified as cohortatives. The first two have pronominal suffixes, so the form itself does not indicate a cohortative.

The blessing of creation is now carried forward to the patriarch. In the garden God blessed Adam and Eve; in that blessing he gave them (1) a fruitful place, (2) endowed them with fertility to multiply, and (3) made them rulers over creation. That was all ruined at the fall. Now God begins to build his covenant people; in Gen 12-22 he promises to give Abram (1) a land flowing with milk and honey, (2) a great nation without number, and (3) kingship.<br /></span></span>  and I will <span class="w H1431" data-lemma="H1431">make</span> your <span class="w H8034" data-lemma="H8034">name</span> <span class="w H1419" data-lemma="H1419">great</span>,<span class="note"><span class="key">7</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;I will make you famous.&#8221;<br /></span></span>   so that you will exemplify <span class="t1">divine</span> <span class="w H1293" data-lemma="H1293">blessing</span>.<span class="note"><span class="key">8</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and be a blessing.&#8221; The verb form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1461;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">h&#255;yeh</font>) is the Qal imperative of the verb <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hayah</font>). The <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) with the imperative after the cohortatives indicates purpose or consequence. What does it mean for Abram to &#8220;be a blessing&#8221;? Will he be a channel or source of blessing for others, or a prime example of divine blessing? A similar statement occurs in <ref id="22990">Zech 8:13</ref>, where God assures his people, &#8220;You will be a blessing,&#8221; in contrast to the past when they &#8220;were a curse.&#8221; Certainly &#8220;curse&#8221; here does not refer to Israel being a source of a curse, but rather to the fact that they became a curse-word or byword among the nations, who regarded them as the epitome of an accursed people (see <ref id="10165">2 Kgs 22:19</ref>; <ref id="19994, 20019, 20023, 20033">Jer 42:18; 44:8, 12, 22</ref>). Therefore the statement &#8220;be a blessing&#8221; seems to refer to Israel being transformed into a prime example of a blessed people, whose name will be used in blessing formulae, rather than in curses. If the statement &#8220;be a blessing&#8221; is understood in the same way in <ref id="301">Gen 12:2</ref>, then it means that God would so bless Abram that other nations would hear of his fame and hold him up as a paradigm of divine blessing in their blessing formulae.<br /></span></span>   </span>
<span class="verse Gen_12_3" data-osis="Gen.12.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>I will <span class="w H1288" data-lemma="H1288">bless</span> those who <span class="w H1288" data-lemma="H1288">bless</span> you,<span class="note"><span class="key">9</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The Piel cohortative has as its object a Piel participle, masculine plural. Since the <sc>Lord</sc> binds himself to Abram by covenant, those who enrich Abram in any way share in the blessings.<br /></span></span>  but the one who <span class="w H7043" data-lemma="H7043">treats</span> you <span class="w H7043" data-lemma="H7043">lightly</span><span class="note"><span class="key">10</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> In this part of God&#8217;s statement there are two significant changes that often go unnoticed. First, the parallel and contrasting participle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1456;&#1511;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1500;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">m&#255;qallelkha</font>) is now singular and not plural. All the versions and a few Masoretic <sc>mss</sc> read the plural. But if it had been plural, there would be no reason to change it to the singular and alter the parallelism. On the other hand, if it was indeed singular, it is easy to see why the versions would change it to match the first participle. The MT preserves the original reading: &#8220;the one who treats you lightly.&#8221; The point would be a contrast with the lavish way that God desires to bless many. The second change is in the vocabulary. The English usually says, &#8220;I will curse those who curse you.&#8221; But there are two different words for curse here. The first is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1500;</font> (<font face="Scholar">qalal</font>), which means &#8220;to be light&#8221; in the Qal<i>,</i> and in the Piel &#8220;to treat lightly, to treat with contempt, to curse.&#8221; The second verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1512;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">arar</font>), which means &#8220;to banish, to remove from the blessing.&#8221; The point is simple: Whoever treats Abram and the covenant with contempt as worthless God will banish from the blessing. It is important also to note that the verb is not a cohortative, but a simple imperfect. Since God is binding himself to Abram, this would then be an obligatory imperfect: &#8220;but the one who treats you with contempt <i>I must curse</i>.&#8221;<br /></span></span>   I must <span class="w H779" data-lemma="H779">curse</span>,  and <span class="w H3605" data-lemma="H3605">all</span> the <span class="w H4940" data-lemma="H4940">families</span> of the <span class="w H127" data-lemma="H127">earth</span> will <span class="w H1288" data-lemma="H1288">bless</span> one another<span class="note"><span class="key">11</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> Theoretically the Niphal can be translated either as passive or reflexive/reciprocal. (The Niphal of &#8220;bless&#8221; is only used in formulations of the Abrahamic covenant. See <ref id="301, 443, 788">Gen 12:2; 18:18; 28:14</ref>.) Traditionally the verb is taken as passive here, as if Abram were going to be a channel or source of blessing. But in later formulations of the Abrahamic covenant (see <ref id="566, 697">Gen 22:18; 26:4</ref>) the Hitpael replaces this Niphal form, suggesting a translation &#8220;will bless [i.e., &#8220;pronounce blessings on&#8221;] themselves [or &#8220;one another&#8221;].&#8221; The Hitpael of &#8220;bless&#8221; is used with a reflexive/reciprocal sense in <ref id="5698">Deut 29:18</ref>; <ref id="15018">Ps 72:17</ref>; <ref id="18914">Isa 65:16</ref>; <ref id="19030">Jer 4:2</ref>. <ref id="301">Gen 12:2</ref> predicts that Abram will be held up as a paradigm of divine blessing and that people will use his name in their blessing formulae. For examples of blessing formulae utilizing an individual as an example of blessing see <ref id="1472">Gen 48:20</ref> and <ref id="7202">Ruth 4:11</ref>.<br /></span></span>  by your name.” </span>

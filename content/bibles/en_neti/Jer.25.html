I will bring upon it everything that Jeremiah is going to prophesy concerning all the nations.&#8221; The reference to &#8220;this book&#8221; and &#8220;what Jeremiah has prophesied against the nations&#8221; raises issues about the editorial process underlying the current form of the book of Jeremiah. As the book now stands there is no earlier reference to any judgments against Babylon or any book (really &#8220;scroll&#8221;; books were a development of the first or second century <sc>a.d.</sc>) containing them. A common assumption is that this &#8220;book&#8221; of judgment refers to the judgments against Babylon and the other nations contained at the end of the book of Jeremiah (46:1&#8211;51:58). The Greek version actually inserts the prophecies of 46:1&#8211;51:58 here (but in a different order) and interprets &#8220;Which (= What) Jeremiah prophesied concerning all the nations&#8221; as a title. It is possible that the Greek version may represent an earlier form of the book. At least two earlier forms of the book are known that date roughly to the period dealt with here (Compare <ref id="19844">36:1</ref> with <ref id="19536">25:1</ref> and see <ref id="19845, 19847">36:2, 4</ref> and <ref id="99999, 99999">36:28, 32</ref>). Whether reference here is made to the first or second of these scrolls and whether the Greek version represents either is impossible to determine. It is not inconceivable that the referent here is the prophecies which Jeremiah has already uttered in <ref id="19543-19547">vv. 8-12</ref> and is about to utter in conjunction with the symbolical act that the <sc>Lord</sc> commands him to perform (<ref id="19540-19561">vv. 15-26</ref>, 30-38) and that these are proleptic of the latter prophecies which will be given later and will be incorporated in a future book. That is the tenor of the alternate translation. The verb forms involved are capable of either a past/perfect translation or a proleptic/future translation. For the use of the participle (in the alternate translation = <i>Heb</i> &#8220;that is to be written&#8221;; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;</font>, <font face="Scholar">hakkatuv</font>) to refer to what is proleptic see GKC 356-57 &#167;116.<i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, and compare usage in <ref id="22535">Jonah 1:3</ref>; <ref id="9832">2 Kgs 11:2</ref>. For the use of the perfect to refer to a future act (in the alternate translation &#8220;is going to prophesy,&#8221; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;</font>, <font face="Scholar">nibba</font>&#8217;) see GKC 312 &#167;106.<i>m</i> and compare usage in <ref id="6512">Judg 1:2</ref>. In support of this interpretation is the fact that the first verb in the next verse (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;they will be subjected,&#8221; <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1489;&#1456;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">ovdu</font>) is undoubtedly prophetic [it is followed by a <i>vav</i> consecutive perfect; cf. <ref id="17754">Isa 5:14</ref>]). Reading the text this way has the advantage of situating it within the context of the passage itself which involves prophecies against the nations and against Babylon. Babylon is both the agent of wrath (the cup from which the nations drink, cf. <ref id="20220">51:7</ref>) and the recipient of it (cf. <ref id="19561">v. 26</ref>). However, this interpretation admittedly does not explain the reference to &#8220;this book,&#8221; except as a proleptic reference to some future form of the book and there would be clearer ways of expressing this view if that were what was definitely intended.<br /></span></span>   </span>

The word translated &#8220;lie scattered&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1508;&#1493;&#1465;&#1510;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">t&#255;fotsah</font>) occurs nowhere else and the switch to the simile of &#8220;choice vessels&#8221; is rather abrupt. However, this section has been characterized by switching metaphors. The key to the interpretation and translation here is the consequential nature of the verbal actions involved. &#8220;Fall&#8221; does not merely refer to the action but the effect, i.e., &#8220;lie fallen&#8221; (cf. BDB 657 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1500;</font> 7 and compare <ref id="6594">Judg 3:25</ref>; <ref id="8018">1 Sam 31:8</ref>). Though the noun translated &#8220;lie scattered&#8221; does not occur elsewhere, the verb does. It is quite commonly used of dispersing people and that has led many to see that as the reference here. The word, however, can be used of scattering other things like seed (<ref id="18190">Isa 28:25</ref>), arrows (<ref id="8618">2 Sam 22:15</ref>; metaphorical for lightning), etc. Here it follows &#8220;slaughtered&#8221; and refers to their dead bodies. The simile (<i>Heb</i> &#8220; fallen like choice vessels&#8221;) is elliptical, referring to &#8220;broken pieces&#8221; of choice vessels. In this sense the simile fits in perfectly with <ref id="19568">v. 33</ref>.<br /></span></span>   </span>

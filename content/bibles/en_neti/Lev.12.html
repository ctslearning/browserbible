Her impurity was contagious during this period, so no one should touch her or even furniture on which she has sat or reclined (<ref id="3188-3192">Lev 15:19-23</ref>), lest they too become impure. Even her husband would become impure for seven days if he had sexual intercourse with her during this time (<ref id="3193">Lev 15:24</ref>; cf. <ref id="3271">18:19</ref>). The next thirty-three days were either &#8220;days of purification, purifying&#8221; or &#8220;days of purity,&#8221; depending on how one understands the abstract noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1496;&#1465;&#1492;&#1459;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">toharah</font>, &#8220;purification, purity&#8221;) in this context. During this time the woman could not touch anything holy or enter the sanctuary, but she was no longer contagious like she had been during the first seven days. She could engage in normal everyday life, including sexual intercourse, without fear of contaminating anyone else (B. A. Levine, <i>Leviticus</i> [JPSTC], 73-74; cf. J. Milgrom, <i>Leviticus</i> [AB], <ref id="1-1">1:749-50</ref>). Thus, in a sense, the thirty-three days were a time of blood &#8220;purity&#8221; (cf. the present translation) as compared to the previous seven days of blood &#8220;impurity,&#8221; but they were also a time of blood &#8220;purification&#8221; (or &#8220;purifying&#8221;) as compared to the time after the thirty-three days, when the blood atonement had been made and she was pronounced &#8220;clean&#8221; by the priest (see <ref id="3051-3053">vv. 6-8</ref> below). In other words, the thirty-three day period was a time of &#8220;blood&#8221; (flow), but this was &#8220;pure blood,&#8221; as opposed to the blood of the first seven days.<br /></span></span>   </span>

Milgrom, <i>Leviticus</i> [AB], <ref id="1-1">1:750-51</ref>; and G. J. Wenham, <i>Leviticus</i> [NICOT], 188). Some have argued, for example, that it derives from the relative status of the sexes, or a supposed longer blood flow for the birth of a woman, or even to compensate for the future menstrual periods of the female just born. Perhaps there is a better explanation. First, a male child <i>must</i> be circumcised on the eighth day, so the impurity of the mother could not last beyond the first seven days lest it interfere with the circumcision rite. A female child, of course, was not circumcised, so the impurity of the mother would not interfere and the length of the impure time could be extended further. Second, it would be natural to expect that the increased severity of the blood flow after childbirth, as compared to that of a woman&#8217;s menstrual period, would call for a longer period of impurity than the normal seven days of the menstrual period impurity (compare <ref id="3188">Lev 15:19</ref> with <ref id="3194-3199">15:25-30</ref>). Third, this suggests that the fourteen day impurity period for the female child would have been more appropriate, and the impurity period for the birth of a male child had to be shortened. Fourth, not only the principle of multiples of seven but also multiples of forty applies to this reckoning. Since the woman&#8217;s blood discharge after bearing a child continues for more than seven days, her discharge keeps her from contact with sacred things for a longer period of time in order to avoid contaminating the tabernacle (note <ref id="3200">Lev 15:31</ref>). This ended up totaling forty days for the birth of a male child (seven plus thirty-three) and a corresponding doubling of the second set of days for the woman (fourteen plus sixty-six). See R. E. Averbeck, <i>NIDOTTE</i> <ref id="1-1">2:368-70</ref>. The fact that the offerings were the same for either a male or a female infant (<ref id="3051-3053">vv. 6-8</ref>) suggests that the other differences in the regulations are not due to the notion that a male child had greater intrinsic value than a female child (J. E. Hartley, <i>Leviticus</i> [WBC], 169).<br /></span></span>   </span>

In this case, the woman has not &#8220;sinned&#8221; morally by having a child.

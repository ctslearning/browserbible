<h3>Blessing during Bondage in Egypt</h3>
<p>

The first seven verses announce the theme of Israel&#8217;s prosperity in Egypt. The second section (<ref id="1541-1547">vv. 8-14</ref>) reports continued prosperity in the face of deliberate opposition. The third section (<ref id="1538-1554">vv. 15-21</ref>) explains the prosperity as divine favor in spite of Pharaoh&#8217;s covert attempts at controlling the population. The final verse records a culmination in the developing tyranny and provides a transition to the next section &#8211; Pharaoh commands the open murder of the males. The power of God is revealed in the chapter as the people flourish under the forces of evil. However, by the turn of affairs at the end of the chapter, the reader is left with a question about the power of God &#8211; &#8220;What can God do?&#8221; This is good Hebrew narrative, moving the reader through tension after tension to reveal the sovereign power and majesty of the <sc>Lord</sc> God, but calling for faith every step of the way.

But the expression is probably also intended to indicate that they are the Israelites (cf. <ref id="797">Gen 29:1</ref>, &#8220;eastern people,&#8221; or &#8220;easterners,&#8221; lit., &#8220;sons of the east&#8221;).<br /></span></span>   who <span class="w H935" data-lemma="H935">entered</span> <span class="w H4714" data-lemma="H4714">Egypt</span>–  each <span class="w H376" data-lemma="H376">man</span> with his <span class="w H1004" data-lemma="H1004">household</span><span class="note"><span class="key">5</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a man and his house.&#8221; Since this serves to explain &#8220;the sons of Israel,&#8221; it has the distributive sense.

Merrill in conjunction with F. Delitzsch notes that the list in Gen 46 of those who entered Egypt includes Hezron and Hamul, who did so <i>in potentia</i>, since they were born after the family entered Egypt. Joseph&#8217;s sons are also included, though they too were born in Egypt. &#8220;The list must not be pressed too literally&#8221; (E. H.

Scholars who take the numbers in the Bible more or less at face value would place the time of Jacob&#8217;s going down to Egypt in about 1876 <sc>b.c</sc>. This would put Joseph&#8217;s experience in the period prior to the Hyksos control of Egypt (1720-1570&#8217;s), and everything in the narrative about Joseph points to a native Egyptian setting and not a Hyksos one. Joseph&#8217;s death, then, would have been around 1806 <sc>b.c.</sc>, just a few years prior to the end of the 12th Dynasty of Egypt. This marked the end of the mighty Middle Kingdom of Egypt. The relationship between the Hyksos (also Semites) and the Israelites may have been amicable, and the Hyksos then might very well be the enemies that the Egyptians feared in <ref id="1543">Exodus 1:10</ref>. It makes good sense to see the new king who did not know Joseph as either the founder (Amosis, 1570-1546) or an early king of the powerful 18th Dynasty (like Thutmose I). Egypt under this new leadership drove out the Hyksos and reestablished Egyptian sovereignty. The new rulers certainly would have been concerned about an increasing Semite population in their territory (see E. H.

But if the details of the context are taken as seriously as the mention of this name, this cannot be the case. If one grants for the sake of discussion that Rameses II was on the throne and oppressing Israel, it is necessary to note that Moses is not born yet. It would take about twenty or more years to build the city, then eighty more years before Moses appears before Pharaoh (Rameses), and then a couple of years for the plagues &#8211; this man would have been Pharaoh for over a hundred years. That is clearly not the case for the historical Rameses II. But even more determining is the fact that whoever the Pharaoh was for whom the Israelites built the treasure cities, he died before Moses began the plagues. The Bible says that when Moses grew up and killed the Egyptian, he fled from Pharaoh (whoever that was) and remained in exile until he heard that that Pharaoh had died. So this verse cannot be used for a date of the exodus in the days of Rameses, unless many other details in the chapters are ignored. If it is argued that Rameses was the Pharaoh of the oppression, then his successor would have been the Pharaoh of the exodus. Rameses reigned from 1304 <sc>b.c.</sc> until 1236 and then was succeeded by Merneptah. That would put the exodus far too late in time, for the Merneptah stela refers to Israel as a settled nation in their land. One would have to say that the name Rameses in this chapter may either refer to an earlier king, or, more likely, reflect an updating in the narrative to name the city according to its later name (it was called something else when they built it, but later Rameses finished it and named it after himself [see B. Jacob, <i>Exodus</i>, 14]). For further discussion see G. L. Archer, &#8220;An 18th Dynasty Ramses,&#8221; <i>JETS</i> 17 (1974): 49-50; and C. F.

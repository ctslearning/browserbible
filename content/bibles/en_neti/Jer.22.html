In that case something like: &#8220;How sad it is for the one who was like a brother to us! How sad it is for the one who was like a sister to us.&#8221; This makes for poor poetry and is not very likely. The lover can call his bride sister in Song of Solomon (<ref id="17592, 17593">Song 4:9, 10</ref>) but there are no documented examples of a subject ever speaking of a king in this way in Israel or the ancient Near East.<br /></span></span>   </span>

According to <ref id="19623, 19629">Jer 28:4, 10</ref>, there were popular hopes that he would be restored from exile and returned to the throne. This oracle flatly denies that hope.

As God&#8217;s representative he ruled in God&#8217;s stead and could even be addressed figuratively as God (cf. <ref id="14604">Ps 45:6</ref> [<ref id="99999">45:7</ref> HT]) and compare the same phenomenon for the earthly judges, <ref id="2121-2122">Exod 22:7-8</ref>; <ref id="15235, 15240">Ps 82:1, 6</ref>). Jeconiah is being denied the right to function any longer as the Davidic king and any hopes of ever regaining that right in his lifetime or through the succession of his sons is also denied. This oracle is reversed by the later oracle of the prophet Haggai to his grandson Zerubbabel in <ref id="22876-22879">Hag 2:20-23</ref> and both Jeconiah and Zerubbabel are found in the genealogy of Christ in <ref id="23157-23158">Matt 1:12-13</ref>.<br /></span></span> </span>

The word translated &#8220;childless&#8221; has spawned some debate because Jeconiah was in fact not childless. There is record from both the Bible and ancient Near Eastern texts that he had children (see, e.g., <ref id="10379">1 Chr 3:17</ref>). G. R. Driver, &#8220;Linguistic and Textual Problems: Jeremiah,&#8221; <i>JQR</i> 28 (1937-38): 115, has suggested that the word both here and in <ref id="3339-3340">Lev 20:20-21</ref> should be translated &#8220;stripped of honor.&#8221; While that would relieve some of the difficulties here, the word definitely means &#8220;childless&#8221; in <ref id="363">Gen 15:2</ref> and also in Sir <ref id="19340">16:3</ref> where it is contrasted with having godless children. The issue is not one of childlessness but of having &#8220;one of his sons&#8221; succeed to the Davidic throne. The term for &#8220;one of his sons&#8221; is literally &#8220;from his seed a man&#8221; and the word &#8220;seed&#8221; is the same one that is used to refer to his &#8220;children&#8221; who were forced into exile with him (<ref id="19483">v. 28</ref>).<br /><br/></br><b>sn</b> The figure here is of registering a person on an official roll of citizens, etc. (cf. <ref id="4051">Num 11:26</ref>; <ref id="10427">1 Chr 4:41</ref>; <ref id="15308">Ps 87:6</ref>). Here it probably refers to the &#8220;king list&#8221; of dynastic succession. While Jeconiah did have children (<ref id="11247">2 Chr 3:17</ref>) none of them ever returned to Judah or ruled over it. What is being denied here is his own succession and that of his immediate sons contrary to the popular hopes expressed in <ref id="19623">Jer 28:4</ref>.

This figure has already been used in <ref id="19039-19040">4:11-12</ref> and in <ref id="20164">49:36</ref>. See the study note on <ref id="19039-19040">4:11-12</ref> and the translator&#8217;s notes on <ref id="19477">22:22</ref> and <ref id="99999">49:36</ref>.<br /></span></span>   to <span class="w H5782" data-lemma="H5782">blow</span> <span class="w H5921" data-lemma="H5921">against</span><span class="note"><span class="key">2</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;I will arouse the spirit of hostility of a destroying nation&#8221;; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will stir up against Babylon&#8230;a destroying wind [or the spirit of a destroyer].&#8221; The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ruakh</font>) can refer to either a wind (BDB 924 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font> 2.a) or a spirit (BDB 925 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font> 2.g). It can be construed as either a noun followed by an adjectival participle (so, &#8220;a destroying wind&#8221;) or a noun followed by another noun in the &#8220;of&#8221; relationship (a construct or genitival relationship; so, &#8220;spirit of a destroyer&#8221;). The same noun with this same verb is translated &#8220;stir up the spirit of&#8221; in <ref id="10455">1 Chr 5:26</ref>; <ref id="11641, 12016">2 Chr 21:16; 36:22</ref>; <ref id="22855">Hag 1:14</ref>; and most importantly in <ref id="20224">Jer 51:11</ref> where it refers to the king of the Medes. However, the majority of the exegetical tradition (all the commentaries consulted and all the English versions except NASB and NIV) opt for the &#8220;destructive wind&#8221; primarily because of the figure of winnowing that is found in the next verse. The translation follows the main line exegetical tradition here for that same reason.<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H894" data-lemma="H894">Babylon</span> and the <span class="w H3427" data-lemma="H3427">people who inhabit</span> Babylonia.<span class="note"><span class="key">3</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the people who live in Leb-qamai.&#8221; &#8220;Leb-qamai&#8221; is a code name for &#8220;Chaldeans&#8221; formed on the principle of substituting the last letter of the alphabet for the first, the next to the last for the second, and so on. This same principle is used in referring to Babylon in <ref id="19561">25:26</ref> and <ref id="99999">51:41</ref> as &#8220;Sheshach.&#8221; See the study note on <ref id="19561">25:26</ref> where further details are given. There is no consensus on why the code name is used because the terms Babylon and Chaldeans (= Babylonians) have appeared regularly in this prophecy or collection of prophecies.<br /></span></span> </span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_2" data-osis="Jer.51.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>I will <span class="w H7971" data-lemma="H7971">send</span> <span class="w H2114" data-lemma="H2114">people</span> to <span class="t1">winnow</span> <span class="w H894" data-lemma="H894">Babylonia</span> like a <span class="w H2219" data-lemma="H2219">wind blowing away chaff</span>.<span class="note"><span class="key">4</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;I will send foreign people against Babylonia.&#8221; The translation follows the reading of the Greek recensions of Aquila and Symmachus and the Latin version (the Vulgate). That reading is accepted by the majority of modern commentaries and several of the modern versions (e.g., NRSV, REB, NAB, and God&#8217;s Word). It fits better with the verb that follows it than the reading of the Hebrew text and the rest of the versions. The difference in the two readings is again only the difference in vocalization, the Hebrew text reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<i>zarim</i>) and the versions cited reading <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1494;&#1465;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<i>zorim</i>). If the Hebrew text is followed, there is a wordplay between the two words, &#8220;foreigners&#8221; and &#8220;winnow.&#8221; The words &#8220;like a wind blowing away chaff&#8221; have been supplied in the translation to clarify for the reader what &#8220;winnow&#8221; means.<br /><br/></br><b>sn</b> Winnowing involved throwing a mixture of grain and chaff (or straw) into the air and letting the wind blow away the lighter chaff, leaving the grain to fall on the ground. Since God considered all the Babylonians chaff, they would all be &#8220;blown away.&#8221;<br /></span></span>   They will <span class="w H1238" data-lemma="H1238">winnow</span> her and strip her <span class="w H776" data-lemma="H776">land</span> bare.<span class="note"><span class="key">5</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;They will strip her land bare like a wind blowing away chaff.&#8221; The alternate translation would be necessary if one were to adopt the alternate reading of the first line (the reading of the Hebrew text). The explanation of &#8220;winnow&#8221; would then be necessary in the second line. The verb translated &#8220;strip&#8230;bare&#8221; means literally &#8220;to empty out&#8221; (see BDB 132 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1511;</font> Polel). It has been used in <ref id="19415">19:7</ref> in the Qal of &#8220;making void&#8221; Judah&#8217;s plans in a wordplay on the word for &#8220;bottle.&#8221; See the study note on <ref id="19415">19:7</ref> for further details.<br /></span></span>  This <span class="w H1961" data-lemma="H1961">will happen when</span><span class="note"><span class="key">6</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> This assumes that the particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) is temporal (cf. BDB 473 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> 2.a). This is the interpretation adopted also by NRSV and G. L. Keown, P. J. Scalise, T. G. Smothers, <i>Jeremiah 26-52</i> (WBC), 349. J. Bright (<i>Jeremiah</i> [AB], 345) and J. A. Thompson (<i>Jeremiah</i> [NICOT], 747, n. 3) interpret it as asseverative or emphatic, &#8220;Truly, indeed.&#8221; Many of the modern English versions merely ignore it. Reading it as temporal makes it unnecessary to emend the following verb as Bright and Thompson do (from <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;</font> [<font face="Scholar">hayu</font>] to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1460;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;</font> [<font face="Scholar">yihyu</font>]).<br /></span></span>   they come <span class="w H5921" data-lemma="H5921">against</span> her from <span class="w H5439" data-lemma="H5439">every direction</span>,  when it is <span class="w H3117" data-lemma="H3117">time</span> to <span class="w H7451" data-lemma="H7451">destroy</span> her.<span class="note"><span class="key">7</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;in the day of disaster.&#8221;<br /></span></span> </span>

Literally the Masoretic reads &#8220;against let him string let him string the one who strings his bow and against let him raise himself up in his coat of armor.&#8221; This makes absolutely no sense and the ancient versions and Hebrew <sc>mss</sc> did not agree in reading this same text. Many Hebrew <sc>mss</sc> and all the versions as well as the Masoretes themselves (the text is left unpointed with a marginal note not to read it) delete the second &#8220;let him string.&#8221; The LXX (or Greek version) left out the words &#8220;against&#8221; at the beginning of the first two lines. It reads &#8220;Let the archer bend his bow and let the one who has armor put it on.&#8221; The Lucianic recension of the LXX and some Targum <sc>mss</sc> supplied the missing object &#8220;it&#8221; and thus read &#8220;Let the archer ready his bow against it and let him array himself against it in his coat of mail.&#8221; This makes good sense but does not answer the question of why the Hebrew text left off the suffix on the preposition twice in a row. Many Hebrew <sc>mss</sc> and the Syriac, Targum, and Vulgate (the Latin version) change the pointing of &#8220;against&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">el</font>]) to &#8220;not&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al</font>]) and thus read &#8220;Let the archer not string the bow and let him not array himself in his armor.&#8221; However, many commentators feel that this does not fit the context because it would apparently be addressed to the Babylonians, not the enemy, which would create a sudden shift in addressee with the second half of the verse. However, if it is understood in the sense taken here it refers to the enemy not allowing the Babylonian archers to get ready for the battle, i.e., a surprise attack. This sense is suggested as an alternative in J. Bright, <i>Jeremiah</i> (AB), 346, n. u-u, and J. A. Thompson, <i>Jeremiah</i> (NICOT), 747, n. 5, and is the interpretation adopted in TEV and probably also in NIrV.<br /></span></span>   Do not <span class="w H2550" data-lemma="H2550">spare</span> any of her <span class="w H970" data-lemma="H970">young men</span>.

It is commonly translated as has been done here.<br /><br/></br><b>sn</b> The verses from <ref id="20218">v. 5</ref> to <ref id="20232">v. 19</ref> all speak of the <sc>Lord</sc> in the third person.

In this case the particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) is concessive (cf. BDB 473 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> 2.c[b]). Many of the modern commentaries understand the referent to be the land of the Chaldeans/Babylonians. However, most of them feel that the line is connected as a causal statement to <ref id="20215-20217">51:2-4</ref> and see the line as either textually or logically out of place. However, it need not be viewed as logically out of place. It is parallel to the preceding and gives a second reason why they are to be destroyed. It also forms an excellent transition to the next lines where the exiles and other foreigners are urged to flee and not get caught up in the destruction which is coming &#8220;because of her sin.&#8221; It might be helpful to note that both the adjective &#8220;widowed&#8221; and the suffix on &#8220;their God&#8221; are masculine singular, looking at Israel and Judah as one entity. The &#8220;their&#8221; then goes back not to Israel and Judah of the preceding lines but to the &#8220;them&#8221; in <ref id="20217">v. 4</ref>. This makes for a better connection with the following and understands the particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> in its dominant usage not an extremely rare one (see the comment in BDB 473 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> 2.c[b]).

For this figure see <ref id="4921">Deut 1:28</ref> in comparison with <ref id="4104">Num 13:28</ref> and see also <ref id="5159">Deut 9:1</ref>. In both of the passages in Deut it refers to an exaggeration about the height of the walls of fortified cities. The figure also may be a play on <ref id="271">Gen 11:4</ref> where the nations gather in Babylon to build a tower that reaches to the skies. The present translation has interpreted the perfects here as prophetic because it has not happened yet or they would not be encouraging one another to leave and escape.

However, Judah&#8217;s acts of righteousness (or more simply, their righteousness) was scarcely revealed in their deliverance. Most of the English versions and commentaries refer to &#8220;vindication&#8221; i.e., that the <sc>Lord</sc> has exonerated or proven Israel&#8217;s claims to be true. However, that would require more explanation than the idea of &#8220;deliverance&#8221; which is a perfectly legitimate usage of the term (cf.

However, S. R. Driver, <i>Jeremiah</i>, 317, n. c maintains that <ref id="20237">v. 24</ref> speaks against this. It does seem a little inconsistent to render the <i>vav</i> consecutive perfect at the beginning of <ref id="20237">v. 24</ref> as future while rendering those in <ref id="20233">vv. 20</ref>b-23 as customary past. However, change in person from second masculine singular (<ref id="20233">vv. 20</ref>b-23) to the second masculine plural in &#8220;before your very eyes&#8221; and its position at the end of the verse after &#8220;which they did in Zion&#8221; argue that a change in address occurs there. Driver has to ignore the change in person and take &#8220;before your eyes&#8221; with the verb &#8220;repay&#8221; at the beginning to maintain the kind of consistency he seeks. The <i>vav</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>) consecutive imperfect can be used for either the customary past (GKC 335-36 &#167;112.<i>dd</i> with cross reference back to GKC 331-32 &#167;112.<i>e</i>) or the future (GKC 334 &#167;112.<i>x</i>). Hence the present translation has followed the majority of commentaries (and English versions like TEV, NCV, CEV, NIrV) in understanding the referent as Babylon and <ref id="20237">v. 24</ref> being a transition to <ref id="20218-20239">vv. 25-26</ref> (cf., e.g., J. Bright, <i>Jeremiah</i> [AB], 356-57, and J. A. Thompson, <i>Jeremiah</i> [NICOT], 756-57). If the referent is understood as Media then the verbs in <ref id="99999-20236">vv. 20-23</ref> should all be translated as futures.

The LXX (the Greek version) renders the word &#8220;kings&#8221; as singular and levels all the pronouns to &#8220;his,&#8221; paraphrasing the final clause and combining it with &#8220;king of the Medes&#8221; to read &#8220;and of all the earth.&#8221; The Latin Vulgate levels them all to the third masculine plural, and this is followed by the present translation as well as a number of other modern English versions (NASB, NIV, NRSV, TEV, NCV). The ASV and NJPS understand the feminine to refer to Media, i.e., &#8220;her governors and all her prefects&#8221; and understand the masculine in the last line to be a distributive singular referring back to the lands each of the governors and prefects ruled over. This is probably correct but since governors and prefects refer to officials appointed over provinces and vassal states it amounts to much the same interpretation that the Latin Vulgate, the present translation, and other modern English versions have given.<br /></span></span> </span>

At harvest time the stalks of grain were cut down, gathered in sheaves, taken to the harvest floor where the grain was loosened from the husk by driving oxen and threshing sleds over them. The grain was then separated from the mixture of grain, straw and husks by repeatedly throwing it in the air and letting the wind blow away the lighter husks and ground-up straw. The figure of harvest is often used of judgment in the OT. See, e.g., <ref id="22357">Joel 3:13</ref> (<ref id="19041">4:13</ref> Hebrew text) and <ref id="22179">Hos 6:11</ref> and compare also <ref id="22633-22634">Mic 4:12-13</ref> and <ref id="20215">Jer 51:2</ref> where different steps in this process are also used figuratively in connection with judgment.

The pronominal suffixes are first common plural but the versions all read them as first common singular which the Masoretes also do in the <i>Qere</i>. That reading has been followed here for consistency with the next verse which identifies the speaker as the person living in Zion and the personified city of Jerusalem. The Hebrew text reads: &#8220;Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon devoured me [cf. <ref id="20174, 20184">50:7, 17</ref>] and threw me into confusion. He set me down an empty dish.

Hence various proposals have been made to understand it in a different sense. The present translation has followed W. L.

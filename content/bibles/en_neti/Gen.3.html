<h3>The Temptation and the Fall</h3>
<p>
<span class="verse Gen_3_1" data-osis="Gen.3.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Now<span class="note"><span class="key">1</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The chapter begins with a disjunctive clause (conjunction + subject + predicate) that introduces a new character and a new scene in the story.<br /></span></span>  the <span class="w H5175" data-lemma="H5175">serpent</span><span class="note"><span class="key">2</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> Many theologians identify or associate <i>the serpent</i> with Satan. In this view Satan comes in the disguise of a serpent or speaks through a serpent. This explains the serpent&#8217;s capacity to speak. While later passages in the Bible may indicate there was a satanic presence behind the serpent (see, for example, <ref id="30901">Rev 12:9</ref>), the immediate context pictures the serpent as simply one of the animals of the field created by God (see <ref id="57">vv. 1</ref>, 14). An ancient Jewish interpretation explains the reference to the serpent in a literal manner, attributing the capacity to speak to all the animals in the orchard. This text (<i>Jub.</i> <ref id="99999">3:28</ref>) states, &#8220;On that day [the day the man and woman were expelled from the orchard] the mouth of all the beasts and cattle and birds and whatever walked or moved was stopped from speaking because all of them used to speak to one another with one speech and one language [presumed to be Hebrew, see <ref id="99999">12:26</ref>].&#8221; Josephus, <i>Ant.</i> 1.1.4 (1.41) attributes the serpent&#8217;s actions to jealousy. He writes that &#8220;the serpent, living in the company of Adam and his wife, grew jealous of the blessings which he supposed were destined for them if they obeyed God&#8217;s behests, and, believing that disobedience would bring trouble on them, he maliciously persuaded the woman to taste of the tree of wisdom.&#8221;<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H1961" data-lemma="H1961">was</span> more <span class="w H6175" data-lemma="H6175">shrewd</span><span class="note"><span class="key">3</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">arum</font>) basically means &#8220;clever.&#8221; This idea then polarizes into the nuances &#8220;cunning&#8221; (in a negative sense, see <ref id="12964, 13209">Job 5:12; 15:5</ref>), and &#8220;prudent&#8221; in a positive sense (<ref id="16736, 16743, 16764, 16781, 16788, 16791, 17019, 17182">Prov 12:16, 23; 13:16; 14:8, 15, 18; 22:3; 27:12</ref>). This same polarization of meaning can be detected in related words derived from the same root (see <ref id="2092">Exod 21:14</ref>; <ref id="6042">Josh 9:4</ref>; <ref id="7833">1 Sam 23:22</ref>; <ref id="12965">Job 5:13</ref>; <ref id="15245">Ps 83:3</ref>). The negative nuance obviously applies in Gen 3, where the snake attempts to talk the woman into disobeying God by using half-truths and lies.<br /><br/></br><b>sn</b> There is a wordplay in Hebrew between the words &#8220;naked&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">arummim</font>) in <ref id="56">2:25</ref> and &#8220;shrewd&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">arum</font>) in <ref id="57">3:1</ref>. The point seems to be that the integrity of the man and the woman is the focus of the serpent&#8217;s craftiness.

The construction makes this emphatic because normally the negative particle precedes the finite verb.

Here the serpent is more aware of what the <sc>Lord</sc> God said than the woman was; he simply adds a blatant negation to what God said.

On the one hand, <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1465;&#1491;&#1456;&#1506;&#1461;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yod&#255;</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">e</font>) could be taken as a substantival participle functioning as a predicative adjective in the sentence. In this case one might translate: &#8220;You will be, like God himself, knowers of good and evil.&#8221; On the other hand, it could be taken as an attributive adjective modifying <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">elohim</font>). In this case <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> has to be taken as a numerical plural referring to &#8220;gods,&#8221; &#8220;divine beings,&#8221; for if the one true God were the intended referent, a singular form of the participle would almost certainly appear as a modifier. Following this line of interpretation, one could translate, &#8220;You will be like divine beings who know good and evil.&#8221; The following context may favor this translation, for in <ref id="78">3:22</ref> God says to an unidentified group, &#8220;Look, the man has become like one of <i>us</i>, knowing good and evil.&#8221; It is probable that God is addressing his heavenly court (see the note on the word &#8220;make&#8221; in <ref id="26">1:26</ref>), the members of which can be called &#8220;gods&#8221; or &#8220;divine beings&#8221; from the ancient Israelite perspective. (We know some of these beings as messengers or &#8220;angels.&#8221;) An examination of parallel constructions shows that a predicative understanding (&#8220;you will be, like God himself, knowers of good and evil,&#8221; cf. NIV, NRSV) is possible, but rare (see <ref id="751">Gen 27:23</ref>, where &#8220;hairy&#8221; is predicative, complementing the verb &#8220;to be&#8221;). The statistical evidence strongly suggests that the participle is attributive, modifying &#8220;divine beings&#8221; (see <ref id="14344">Ps 31:12</ref>; <ref id="17685, 17921, 17972, 18199, 18798">Isa 1:30; 13:14; 16:2; 29:5; 58:11</ref>; <ref id="19303, 19432, 19494, 19704, 20122, 20150">Jer 14:9; 20:9; 23:9; 31:12; 48:41; 49:22</ref>; <ref id="22190">Hos 7:11</ref>; <ref id="22422">Amos 4:11</ref>). In all of these texts, where a comparative clause and accompanying adjective/participle follow a copulative (&#8220;to be&#8221;) verb, the adjective/participle is attributive after the noun in the comparative clause.<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H2896" data-lemma="H2896">good</span> and <span class="w H7451" data-lemma="H7451">evil</span>.”<span class="note"><span class="key">14</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> <i>You will be like divine beings who know good and evil</i>. The serpent raises doubts about the integrity of God. He implies that the only reason for the prohibition was that God was protecting the divine domain. If the man and woman were to eat, they would enter into that domain. The temptation is to overstep divinely established boundaries. (See D. E. Gowan, <i>When Man Becomes God</i> [PTMS], 25.)<br /></span></span>   </span>

The word &#8220;heel&#8221; is an adverbial accusative, locating the blow. A bite on the heel from a poisonous serpent is potentially fatal.<br /><br/></br><b>sn</b> The etiological nature of <ref id="71">v. 15</ref> is apparent, though its relevance for modern western man is perhaps lost because we rarely come face to face with poisonous snakes. Ancient Israelites, who often encountered snakes in their daily activities (see, for example, <ref id="17502">Eccl 10:8</ref>; <ref id="22443">Amos 5:19</ref>), would find the statement quite meaningful as an explanation for the hostility between snakes and humans. (In the broader ancient Near Eastern context, compare the Mesopotamian serpent omens. See H. W. F. Saggs, <i>The Greatness That Was Babylon</i>, 309.) This ongoing struggle, when interpreted in light of <ref id="71">v. 15</ref>, is a tangible reminder of the conflict introduced into the world by the first humans&#8217; rebellion against God. Many Christian theologians (going back to Irenaeus) understand <ref id="71">v. 15</ref> as the so-called <i>protevangelium</i>, supposedly prophesying Christ&#8217;s victory over Satan (see W. Witfall, &#8220;<ref id="71">Genesis 3:15</ref> &#8211; a Protevangelium?&#8221; <i>CBQ</i> 36 [1974]: 361-65; and R. A. Martin, &#8220;The Earliest Messianic Interpretation of <ref id="71">Genesis 3:15</ref>,&#8221; <i>JBL</i> 84 [1965]: 425-27). In this allegorical approach, the woman&#8217;s offspring is initially Cain, then the whole human race, and ultimately Jesus Christ, the <i>offspring</i> (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;seed&#8221;) of the woman (see <ref id="29136">Gal 4:4</ref>). The <i>offspring</i> of the serpent includes the evil powers and demons of the spirit world, as well as those humans who are in the kingdom of darkness (see <ref id="26426">John 8:44</ref>). According to this view, the passage gives the first hint of the gospel. Satan delivers a crippling blow to the Seed of the woman (Jesus), who in turn delivers a fatal blow to the Serpent (first defeating him through the death and resurrection [<ref id="28774-28776">1 Cor 15:55-57</ref>] and then destroying him in the judgment [<ref id="30899-30901, 31046-31049">Rev 12:7-9; 20:7-10</ref>]). However, the grammatical structure of <ref id="71">Gen 3:15</ref>b does not suggest this view. The repetition of the verb &#8220;attack,&#8221; as well as the word order, suggests mutual hostility is being depicted, not the defeat of the serpent. If the serpent&#8217;s defeat were being portrayed, it is odd that the alleged description of his death comes first in the sentence. If he has already been crushed by the woman&#8217;s &#8220;Seed,&#8221; how can he bruise his heel? To sustain the allegorical view, <ref id="71">v. 15</ref>b must be translated in one of the following ways: &#8220;he will crush your head, even though you attack his heel&#8221; (in which case the second clause is concessive) or &#8220;he will crush your head as you attack his heel&#8221; (the clauses, both of which place the subject before the verb, may indicate synchronic action).<br /></span></span>    </span>

But the next clause shows that the pain is associated with conception and childbirth. The two words form a hendiadys (where two words are joined to express one idea, like &#8220;good and angry&#8221; in English), the second explaining the first. &#8220;Conception,&#8221; if the correct meaning of the noun, must be figurative here since there is no pain in conception; it is a synecdoche, representing the entire process of childbirth and child rearing from the very start. However, recent etymological research suggests the noun is derived from a root <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1512;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hrr</font>), not <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1512;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hrh</font>), and means &#8220;trembling, pain&#8221; (see D.

In this case &#8220;pain and trembling&#8221; refers to the physical effects of childbirth. The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1460;&#1510;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">its&#255;von</font>, &#8220;pain&#8221;), an abstract noun related to the verb (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1464;&#1510;&#1463;&#1489;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">atsav</font>), includes more than physical pain.

The precise meaning of the noun <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">t&#255;shuqah</font>, &#8220;desire&#8221;) is debated. Many interpreters conclude that it refers to sexual desire here, because the subject of the passage is the relationship between a wife and her husband, and because the word is used in a romantic sense in <ref id="17639">Song 7:11</ref> HT (<ref id="170">7:10</ref> ET). However, this interpretation makes little sense in <ref id="72">Gen 3:16</ref>. First, it does not fit well with the assertion &#8220;he will dominate you.&#8221; Second, it implies that sexual desire was not part of the original creation, even though the man and the woman were told to multiply. And third, it ignores the usage of the word in <ref id="87">Gen 4:7</ref> where it refers to sin&#8217;s desire to control and dominate Cain. (Even in Song of Songs it carries the basic idea of &#8220;control,&#8221; for it describes the young man&#8217;s desire to &#8220;have his way sexually&#8221; with the young woman.) In <ref id="72">Gen 3:16</ref> the <sc>Lord</sc> announces a struggle, a conflict between the man and the woman. She will desire to control him, but he will dominate her instead. This interpretation also fits the tone of the passage, which is a judgment oracle. See further Susan T.

This also is part of the baser human nature. The translation assumes the imperfect verb form has an objective/indicative sense here. Another option is to understand it as having a modal, desiderative nuance, &#8220;but he will want to dominate you.&#8221; In this case, the <sc>Lord</sc> simply announces the struggle without indicating who will emerge victorious.<br /><br/></br><b>sn</b> This passage is a judgment oracle. It announces that conflict between man and woman will become the norm in human society. It does not depict the NT ideal, where the husband sacrificially loves his wife, as Christ loved the church, and where the wife recognizes the husband&#8217;s loving leadership in the family and voluntarily submits to it. Sin produces a conflict or power struggle between the man and the woman, but in Christ man and woman call a truce and live harmoniously (<ref id="29323-29337">Eph 5:18-32</ref>).<br /></span></span>   you.” </span>

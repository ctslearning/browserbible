Several proposals have been suggested, the most likely of which is that the prophecy was delivered in 609 <sc>b.c.</sc> in conjunction with Pharaoh Necho&#8217;s advance into Palestine to aid the Assyrians. That was the same year that Josiah was killed by Necho at the battle of Megiddo and four years before Necho was defeated by Nebuchadnezzar, the foe from the north. The prophecy presupposes that Ashkelon is still in existence (<ref id="20079">v. 5</ref>) hence it must be before 604 <sc>b.c</sc>. For a fairly complete discussion of the options see G. L. Keown, P. J. Scalise, T. G. Smothers, <i>Jeremiah 26-52</i> (WBC), 299-300.<br /></span></span>    </span>

Here it refers to the foe from the north (<ref id="18961, 19034">Jer 1:14; 4:6</ref>; etc) which is specifically identified with Babylon in Jer 25.

A very similar figure is seen with a related expression in <ref id="18324-18325">Isa 35:3-4</ref>. The sentence has been restructured to put the subject up front and to suggest through shorter sentences more in keeping with contemporary English style the same causal connections. The figures have been interpreted for the sake of clarity for the average reader.<br /></span></span>   </span>

The Philistines had come from there (<ref id="22503">Amos 9:7</ref>) in the wave of migration from the Aegean Islands during the twelfth and eleventh century and had settled on the Philistine plain after having been repulsed from trying to enter Egypt.<br /></span></span>   </span>

A. Thompson, <i>Jeremiah</i> [NICOT], 698; J. Bright, <i>Jeremiah</i> [AB], 310; and see also <i>HALOT</i> 803 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1461;&#1502;&#1462;&#1511;</font>). It is a rare homonym of the word that normally means &#8220;valley&#8221; that seems to be an inappropriate designation of the Philistine plain. Many of the modern English versions and commentaries follow the Greek version which reads here &#8220;remnant of the Anakim&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1458;&#1504;&#1464;&#1511;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">anaqim</font>] instead of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1511;&#1464;&#1501;</font> [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">imqam</font>], a confusion of basically one letter). This emendation is followed by both BDB 771 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1461;&#1502;&#1462;&#1511;</font> and KBL 716 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1461;&#1502;&#1462;&#1511;</font>. The Anakim were generally associated with the southern region around Hebron but an enclave of them was known to have settled in Gaza, Gath, and Ekron, three of the Philistine cities (cf. <ref id="6130">Josh 11:22</ref>). However, the fact that this judgment is directed against the Philistines not the Anakim and that this homonym apparently appears also in <ref id="20132">Jer 49:4</ref> makes the reading of &#8220;power&#8221; more likely here.<br /></span></span>    </span>

NRSV &#8220;makes heavy exactions&#8221;). This seems to go beyond the ordinary taxation for two reasons: (1) this ruler is a &#8220;man of offerings,&#8221; indicating that it is in his nature to do this, and (2) it tears down the country. The word &#8220;offerings&#8221; has been taken to refer to gifts or bribes (cf. NASB, NIV, CEV, NLT), but the word itself suggests more the idea of tribute or taxes that are demanded; this Hebrew word was used in Leviticus for offerings given to the priests, and in <ref id="21647">Ezek 45:16</ref> for taxes. The point seems to be that this ruler or administrator is breaking the backs of the people with heavy taxes or tribute (e.g., <ref id="7381-7388">1 Sam 8:11-18</ref>), and this causes division and strife.<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H2040" data-lemma="H2040">tears</span> it down. </span>

The latter idea would make the verse more powerful: In flattering someone the flatterer is getting himself into a trap (e.g., <ref id="16450, 16581, 17170, 17220">2:16; 7:5; 26:28; 28:23</ref>).<br /></span></span>   </span>

Driver suggests changing the word to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yadon</font>) based on two Hebrew <sc>mss</sc> and an Arabic cognate <i>dana</i>, &#8220;continue.&#8221; He translates it &#8220;but the righteous remains and rejoices&#8221; (&#8220;Problems in the Hebrew Text of Proverbs,&#8221; <i>Bib</i> 32 [1951]: 193-94). None of these changes are particularly helpful. The verb is unusual for a geminate root, but Gesenius shows several places where the same pattern can be seen in other geminate verbs (GKC 180 &#167;67.<i>q</i>). In light of this it is preferable to retain the reading of the MT here.<br /></span></span>   and <span class="w H8055" data-lemma="H8055">rejoice</span>.<span class="note"><span class="key">21</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> These two verbs express the confidence of the righteous &#8211; they have no fears and so can sing.

The difficulty is that the suffix is singular but the apparent referent is plural. (2) One can take it is as a contrast: &#8220;but as for the upright, they seek his life&#8221; &#8211; a fairly straightforward rendering (cf. ASV). The difficulty here is that &#8220;seeking a life&#8221; is normally a hostile act, but it would here be positive: &#8220;seeking&#8221; a life to preserve it.

The LXX has &#8220;grief,&#8221; and this has been adopted by some versions (e.g., NIV, NCV). The idea would be that treating the servant too easily for so long would not train him at all, so he will be of little use, and therefore a grief. J. Reider takes the word to mean &#8220;weakling&#8221; from the Arabic root <i>na&#8217;na</i> (&#8220;to be weak&#8221;), with a noun/adjective form <i>muna&#8217;ana&#8217;</i> (&#8220;weak; feeble&#8221;); see his &#8220;Etymological Studies in Biblical Hebrew,&#8221; <i>VT</i> 4 [1954]: 276-95. This would give a different emphasis to the sentence, but on the whole not very different than the first. In both cases the servant will not be trained well. Rashi, a Jewish scholar who lived <sc>a.d.</sc> 1040-1105, had the translation &#8220;a master.&#8221; The servant trained this way will assume authority in the household even as the son.

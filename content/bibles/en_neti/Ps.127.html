<h3>Psalm 127 </h3>
<p>
<span class="verse Ps_127_1" data-osis="Ps.127.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>A <span class="w H7892" data-lemma="H7892">song</span> of <span class="w H4609" data-lemma="H4609">ascents</span>,<span class="note"><span class="key">2</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> The precise significance of this title, which appears in Pss 120-134, is unclear.

It may refer on the surface level to a literal physical structure in which a family lives, but at a deeper, metaphorical level it refers to building, perpetuating, and maintaining a family line.

See <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1464;&#1499;&#1462;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lakhem</font>, &#8220;for you&#8221;).<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H3651" data-lemma="H3651">Yes</span>,<span class="note"><span class="key">6</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> Here the Hebrew particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1461;&#1503;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ken</font>) is used to stress the following affirmation (see <ref id="5874">Josh 2:4</ref>; <ref id="14842">Ps 63:2</ref>).<br /></span></span>   he can <span class="w H5414" data-lemma="H5414">provide</span> for those whom he <span class="w H3039" data-lemma="H3039">loves</span> even when they <span class="w H8142" data-lemma="H8142">sleep</span>.<span class="note"><span class="key">7</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;he gives to his beloved, sleep.&#8221; The translation assumes that the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1504;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shena</font>&#8217;, &#8220;sleep,&#8221; an alternate form of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">shenah</font>) is an adverbial accusative. The point seems to be this: Hard work by itself is not what counts, but one&#8217;s relationship to God, for God is able to bless an individual even while he sleeps. (There may even be a subtle allusion to the miracle of conception following sexual intercourse; see the reference to the gift of sons in the following verse.) The statement is not advocating laziness, but utilizing hyperbole to give perspective and to remind the addressees that God must be one&#8217;s first priority. Another option is to take &#8220;sleep&#8221; as the direct object: &#8220;yes, he gives sleep to his beloved&#8221; (cf. NIV, NRSV). In this case the point is this: Hard work by itself is futile, for only God is able to bless one with sleep, which metonymically refers to having one&#8217;s needs met. He blesses on the basis of one&#8217;s relationship to him, not on the basis of physical energy expended.<br /></span></span>   </span>

Daughters are certainly wonderful additions to a family, but in ancient Israelite culture sons were the &#8220;arrows&#8221; that gave a man security in his old age, for they could defend the family interests at the city gate, where the legal and economic issues of the community were settled.<br /></span></span>   are a <span class="w H5159" data-lemma="H5159">gift</span> from the <span class="w H3068" data-lemma="H3068">Lord</span>,  the <span class="w H6529" data-lemma="H6529">fruit</span> of the <span class="w H990" data-lemma="H990">womb</span> is a <span class="w H7939" data-lemma="H7939">reward</span>.  </span>

The phrase &#8220;sons of youth&#8221; is elliptical, meaning &#8220;sons [born during the father&#8217;s] youth.&#8221; Such sons will have grown up to be mature adults and will have children of their own by the time the father reaches old age and becomes vulnerable to enemies. Contrast the phrase &#8220;son of old age&#8221; in <ref id="1087">Gen 37:3</ref> (see also <ref id="14592">44:20</ref>), which refers to Jacob&#8217;s age when Joseph was born.<br /></span></span>   </span>

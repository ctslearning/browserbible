The principle of the psalm is certainly applicable to all people, regardless of their gender or age. To facilitate modern application, we translate the gender and age specific &#8220;man&#8221; with the more neutral &#8220;one.&#8221; (Generic &#8220;he&#8221; is employed in <ref id="13942-13943">vv. 2-3</ref>).

NRSV). However, here the singular form may emphasize that godly individuals are usually outnumbered by the wicked.

The wording is reminiscent of <ref id="5860">Josh 1:8</ref>, where the Lord tells Joshua: &#8220;This law scroll must not leave your lips! You must memorize it day and night so you can carefully obey all that is written in it.

Here it could refer to the Lord recognizing the behavior of the godly and, by metonymy, rewarding their godliness with security and prosperity (resulting in the translation, &#8220;the <sc>Lord</sc> rewards the behavior of the godly&#8221;). The present translation takes the verb in the sense of &#8220;mark out&#8221; (cf. <ref id="13430">Job 23:10</ref>), which metonymically could mean &#8220;watch over, protect, guard.&#8221; In this case the &#8220;way of the godly&#8221; is not their behavior, but their course of life or destiny; a translation reflecting this would be &#8220;the <sc>Lord</sc> protects the lives of the godly&#8221; or &#8220;the <sc>Lord</sc> watches over the destiny of the godly&#8221; (cf.

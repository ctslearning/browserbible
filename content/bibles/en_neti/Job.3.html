The Syriac has &#8220;the day on which he was born.&#8221; The context makes it clear that Job meant the day of his birth. But some have tried to offer a different interpretation, such as his destiny or his predicament. For this reason the Syriac clarified the meaning for their readers in much the same way as the present translation does by rendering &#8220;his day&#8221; as &#8220;the day he was born.&#8221; On the Syriac translation of the book of Job, see Heidi M. Szpek, <i>Translation Technique in the Peshitta to Job</i> (SBLDS).<br /></span></span> </span>

First Job cursed the day; now he cursed the night that spoke about what it witnessed. See A. Ehrman, &#8220;A Note on the Verb &#8216;<i>amar</i>,&#8221; <i>JQR</i> 55 (1964/65): 166-67.<br /></span></span>   ‘A <span class="w H1397" data-lemma="H1397">man</span><span class="note"><span class="key">9</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The word is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1462;&#1489;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gever</font>, &#8220;a man&#8221;). The word usually distinguishes a man as strong, distinct from children and women. Translations which render this as &#8220;boy&#8221; (to remove the apparent contradiction of an adult being &#8220;conceived&#8221; in the womb) miss this point.<br /></span></span>   has been <span class="w H2030" data-lemma="H2030">conceived!’</span><span class="note"><span class="key">10</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> The announcement at birth is to the fact that a male was conceived.

The motifs of the night of conception and the day of birth will be developed by Job. For the entire verse, which is more a wish or malediction than a curse, see S. H.

The word may be connected to an Arabic word which means &#8220;to be dark,&#8221; and an Akkadian word meaning &#8220;black.&#8221; It would then have to be repointed throughout its uses to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tsalmut</font>) forming an abstract ending. It would then simply mean &#8220;darkness&#8221; rather than &#8220;shadow of death.&#8221; Or the word can be understood as an idiomatic expression meaning &#8220;gloom&#8221; that is deeper than <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khoshekh</font>; see <i>HALOT</i> 1029 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1510;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1493;&#1462;&#1514;</font>). Since &#8220;darkness&#8221; has already been used in the line, the two together could possibly form a nominal hendiadys: &#8220;Let the deepest darkness&#8230;.&#8221; There is a significant amount of literature on this; one may begin with W.

Some have suggested that the verb is actually the homonym &#8220;pollute.&#8221; This is the reading in the Targum, Syriac, Vulgate, and Rashi, who quotes from <ref id="23097, 23102">Mal 1:7,12</ref>.

Job wishes that all ominous darknesses would terrify that day.

Some commentaries suggest reading this as a conditional clause followed by the present tense translation: &#8220;If I fear a thing it happens to me&#8221; (see A. B. Davidson, <i>Job</i>, 24). The reason for this change is that it is hard for some to think that in his prime Job had such fears. He did have a pure trust and confidence in the <sc>Lord</sc> (<ref id="13258, 13551">16:19; 29:18</ref>ff).

Of course, if the other view of the verse is taken, then this would simply be translated as &#8220;comes,&#8221; and the preceding preterite also given an English present tense translation.<br /></span></span> </span>
<span class="verse Job_3_26" data-osis="Job.3.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>I have <span class="w H3808" data-lemma="H3808">no</span> <span class="w H7951" data-lemma="H7951">ease</span>,<span class="note"><span class="key">97</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The LXX &#8220;peace&#8221; bases its rendering on <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shalam</font>) and not <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shalah</font>), which retains the original <font face="Scholar">vav</font> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>). The verb means &#8220;to be quiet, to be at ease.&#8221;<br /></span></span>   I have <span class="w H3808" data-lemma="H3808">no</span> <span class="w H8252" data-lemma="H8252">quietness;</span> I <span class="w H3808" data-lemma="H3808">cannot</span> <span class="w H5117" data-lemma="H5117">rest;</span><span class="note"><span class="key">98</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The verb is literally &#8220;and I do/can not rest.&#8221; A potential perfect nuance fits this passage well. The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</font> (<font face="Scholar">nuakh</font>, &#8220;rest&#8221;) implies &#8220;rest&#8221; in every sense, especially in contrast to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1465;&#1490;&#1462;&#1494;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rogez</font>, &#8220;turmoil, agitation&#8221; [<ref id="12931">vv. 26</ref> and 17]).<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H7267" data-lemma="H7267">turmoil</span> has <span class="w H935" data-lemma="H935">come</span> upon me.”<span class="note"><span class="key">99</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The last clause simply has &#8220;and trouble came.&#8221; Job is essentially saying that since the trouble has come upon him there is not a moment of rest and relief.<br /></span></span> </span>

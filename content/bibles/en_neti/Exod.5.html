The point is clear that when the people of God attempt to devote their full service and allegiance to God, they encounter opposition from the world. Rather than finding instant blessing and peace, they find conflict. This is the theme that will continue through the plague narratives. But what makes chapter 5 especially interesting is how the people reacted to this opposition. The chapter has three sections: first, the confrontation between Moses and Pharaoh (<ref id="1634-1638">vv. 1-5</ref>); then the report of the stern opposition of the king (<ref id="1639-1647">vv. 6-14</ref>); and finally, the sad account of the effect of this opposition on the people (<ref id="1638-1654">vv. 15-21</ref>).<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H4872" data-lemma="H4872">Moses</span> <span class="w H175" data-lemma="H175">and Aaron</span> <span class="w H935" data-lemma="H935">went</span> <span class="w H413" data-lemma="H413">to</span> <span class="w H6547" data-lemma="H6547">Pharaoh</span> and <span class="w H559" data-lemma="H559">said</span>,  <span class="w H3541" data-lemma="H3541">“Thus</span> <span class="w H559" data-lemma="H559">says</span> the <span class="w H3068" data-lemma="H3068">Lord</span>,<span class="note"><span class="key">2</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Yahweh.&#8221;<br /></span></span>   the <span class="w H430" data-lemma="H430">God</span> of <span class="w H3478" data-lemma="H3478">Israel</span>,  <span class="w H7971" data-lemma="H7971">‘Release</span><span class="note"><span class="key">3</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The form <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;</font> (<font face="Scholar">shallakh</font>), the Piel imperative, has been traditionally translated &#8220;let [my people] go.&#8221; The Qal would be &#8220;send&#8221;; so the Piel &#8220;send away, release, dismiss, discharge.&#8221; B.

So the words here use the more general idea of appearing before their God. They would go to the desert because there was no homeland yet.

<h3>The Assurance of Deliverance</h3>
<p>
<span class="verse Exod_5_22" data-osis="Exod.5.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="w H4872" data-lemma="H4872">Moses</span><span class="note"><span class="key">57</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> In view of the apparent failure of the mission, Moses seeks Yahweh for assurance. The answer from Yahweh not only assures him that all is well, but that there will be a great deliverance. The passage can be divided into three parts: the complaint of Moses (<ref id="1655-1656">5:22-23</ref>), the promise of Yahweh (<ref id="1657-1665">6:1-9</ref>), and the instructions for Moses (<ref id="1666-1669">6:10-13</ref>). Moses complains because God has not delivered his people as he had said he would, and God answers that he will because he is the sovereign covenant God who keeps his word. Therefore, Moses must keep his commission to speak God&#8217;s word. See further, E. A. Martens, &#8220;Tackling Old Testament Theology,&#8221; <i>JETS</i> 20 (1977): 123-32. The message is very similar to that found in the NT, &#8220;Where is the promise of his coming?&#8221; (<ref id="30527">2 Pet 3:4</ref>). The complaint of Moses (<ref id="1655-1656">5:22-23</ref>) can be worded with Peter&#8217;s &#8220;Where is the promise of his coming?&#8221; theme; the assurance from Yahweh (<ref id="1657-1665">6:1-9</ref>) can be worded with Peter&#8217;s &#8220;The Lord is not slack in keeping his promises&#8221; (<ref id="30532">2 Pet 3:9</ref>); and the third part, the instructions for Moses (<ref id="1666-1669">6:10-13</ref>) can be worded with Peter&#8217;s &#8220;Prepare for the day of God and speed its coming&#8221; (<ref id="30535">2 Pet 3:12</ref>). The people who speak for God must do so in the sure confidence of the coming deliverance &#8211; Moses with the deliverance from the bondage of Egypt, and Christians with the deliverance from this sinful world.<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H7725" data-lemma="H7725">returned</span><span class="note"><span class="key">58</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;and Moses returned.&#8221;<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H413" data-lemma="H413">to</span> the <span class="w H3068" data-lemma="H3068">Lord</span>,  and <span class="w H559" data-lemma="H559">said</span>,  <span class="w H136" data-lemma="H136">“Lord</span>,<span class="note"><span class="key">59</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The designation in Moses&#8217; address is &#8220;Lord&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1497;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">adonay</font>) &#8211; the term for &#8220;lord&#8221; or &#8220;master&#8221; but pointed as it would be when it represents the tetragrammaton.<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H4100" data-lemma="H4100">why</span> have you <span class="w H7489" data-lemma="H7489">caused</span> trouble for <span class="w H2088" data-lemma="H2088">this</span> <span class="w H5971" data-lemma="H5971">people</span>?<span class="note"><span class="key">60</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The verb is <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1492;&#1458;&#1512;&#1461;&#1506;&#1465;&#1514;&#1464;&#1492;</font> (<font face="Scholar">hare</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">otah</font>), the Hiphil perfect of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ra</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">a</font>&#8217;). The word itself means &#8220;to do evil,&#8221; and in this stem &#8220;to cause evil&#8221; &#8211; but evil in the sense of pain, calamity, trouble, or affliction, and not always in the sense of sin. Certainly not here. That God had allowed Pharaoh to oppose them had brought greater pain to the Israelites.<br /><br/></br><b>sn</b> Moses&#8217; question is rhetorical; the point is more of a complaint or accusation to God, although there is in it the desire to know why. B. Jacob (<i>Exodus</i>, 139) comments that such frank words were a sign of the man&#8217;s closeness to God. God never has objected to such bold complaints by the devout. He then notes how God was angered by his defenders in the book of Job rather than by Job&#8217;s heated accusations.<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H4100" data-lemma="H4100">Why</span> did you <span class="w H2088" data-lemma="H2088">ever</span><span class="note"><span class="key">61</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The demonstrative pronoun serves for emphasis in the question (see R. J. Williams, <i>Hebrew Syntax</i>, 24, &#167;118). This second question continues Moses&#8217; bold approach to God, more chiding than praying. He is implying that if this was the result of the call, then God had no purpose calling him (compare Jeremiah&#8217;s similar complaint in Jer 20).<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H7971" data-lemma="H7971">send</span> me? </span>

The ultimate cause of the trouble was God, but the immediate cause was Pharaoh and the way he increased the work. Meanwhile, the Israelite foremen have pinned most of the blame on Moses and Aaron. Moses knows all about the sovereignty of God, and as he speaks in God&#8217;s name, he sees the effect it has on pagans like Pharaoh.

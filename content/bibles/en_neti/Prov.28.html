KJV, NASB, NLT. The problem is that the poor in the book of Proverbs is not an oppressor and does not have the power to be such. So commentators assume the word is incorrect. By a slight change to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1506;</font> (<font face="Scholar">rasha</font>&#8217;) the reading becomes &#8220;a wicked ruler&#8221; [<i>Heb</i> &#8220;a wicked mighty man&#8221;]. There is no textual support for this change. The LXX, however, reads, &#8220;A courageous man oppresses the poor with impieties.&#8221; If &#8220;a poor man&#8221; is retained, then the oppression would include betrayal &#8211; one would expect a poor man to have sympathy for others who are impoverished, but in fact that is not the case. It is a sad commentary on human nature that the truly oppressed people can also be oppressed by other poor people.<br /></span></span>   who <span class="w H6231" data-lemma="H6231">oppresses</span> the <span class="w H1800" data-lemma="H1800">weak</span> is like<span class="note"><span class="key">8</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The comparative &#8220;like&#8221; does not appear in the Hebrew text, but is implied by the metaphor; it is supplied in the translation for the sake of clarity.<br /></span></span>  a <span class="w H5502" data-lemma="H5502">driving</span> <span class="w H4306" data-lemma="H4306">rain</span> <span class="w H369" data-lemma="H369">without</span> <span class="w H3899" data-lemma="H3899">food</span>.<span class="note"><span class="key">9</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> &#8220;Food&#8221; is a metonymy of effect here.

However, the expression &#8220;keep the law&#8221; in the second line indicates that it is binding, which would not be true of teaching in general (J.

So the development of the ideas for this proverb require in the first line that &#8220;rejoice&#8221; be connected with &#8220;triumph&#8221; that means they have come to power; and in the second line that &#8220;are sought out&#8221; means people have gone into hiding (cf. ASV, NIV, NRSV, NLT). C. H. Toy thinks this is too strained; he offers this rendering: &#8220;When the righteous are exalted there is great confidence, but when the wicked come into power men hide themselves&#8221; (<i>Proverbs</i> [ICC], 500). For the verb G. R. Driver posits an Arabic cognate <i>hafasa</i>, &#8220;prostrated; trampled on&#8221; (&#8220;Problems in the Hebrew Text of Proverbs,&#8221; <i>Bib</i> 32 [1951]: 192-93), which gives a clearer result of wicked rule, but is perhaps unnecessary (e.g., <ref id="17225, 17227">Prov 28:28; 29:2</ref>).

There is so much literature on it that it is almost impossible to say anything briefly and do justice to the subject. But the exposition of the book must point out that this is the charter of the new nation of Israel. These ten commands (words) form the preamble; they will be followed by the decisions (judgments). And then in chap. 24 the covenant will be inaugurated. So when Israel entered into covenant with God, they entered into a theocracy by expressing their willingness to submit to his authority. The Law was the binding constitution for the nation of Israel under Yahweh their God. It was specifically given to them at a certain time and in a certain place. The Law legislated how Israel was to live in order to be blessed by God and used by him as a kingdom of priests. In the process of legislating their conduct and their ritual for worship, the Law revealed God. It revealed the holiness of Yahweh as the standard for all worship and service, and in revealing that it revealed or uncovered sin. But what the Law condemned, the Law (Leviticus) also made provision for in the laws of the sacrifice and the feasts intended for atonement. The NT teaches that the Law was good, and perfect, and holy. But it also teaches that Christ was the end (goal) of the Law, that it ultimately led to him. It was a pedagogue, Paul said, to bring people to Christ. And when the fulfillment of the promise came in him, believers were not to go back under the Law. What this means for Christians is that what the Law of Israel revealed about God and his will is timeless and still authoritative over faith and conduct, but what the Law regulated for Israel in their existence as the people of God has been done away with in Christ. The Ten Commandments reveal the essence of the Law; the ten for the most part are reiterated in the NT because they reflect the holy and righteous nature of God. The NT often raises them to a higher standard, to guard the spirit of the Law as well as the letter.<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H1696" data-lemma="H1696">spoke</span>  <span class="w H3605" data-lemma="H3605">all</span> <span class="w H428" data-lemma="H428">these</span> <span class="w H1697" data-lemma="H1697">words:</span><span class="note"><span class="key">2</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> The Bible makes it clear that the Law was the revelation of God at Mount Sinai. And yet study has shown that the law code&#8217;s form follows the literary pattern of covenant codes in the Late Bronze Age, notably the Hittite codes. The point of such codes is that all the covenant stipulations are appropriate because of the wonderful things that the sovereign has done for the people. God, in using a well-known literary form, was both drawing on the people&#8217;s knowledge of such to impress their duties on them, as well as putting new wine into old wineskins. The whole nature of God&#8217;s code was on a much higher level. For this general structure, see M. G. Kline, <i>Treaty of the Great King</i>. For the Ten Commandments specifically, see J. J.

<span class="verse Exod_20_3" data-osis="Exod.20.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>“You shall have <span class="w H3808" data-lemma="H3808">no</span><span class="note"><span class="key">7</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The possession is expressed here by the use of the <i>lamed</i> (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;</font>) preposition and the verb &#8220;to be&#8221;: <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;&#1470;&#1497;&#1460;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1462;&#1492; &#1500;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;</font> (<font face="Scholar">lo</font>&#8217; <font face="Scholar">yihyeh l&#255;kha</font>, &#8220;there will not be to you&#8221;). The negative with the imperfect expresses the emphatic prohibition; it is best reflected with &#8220;you will not&#8221; and has the strongest expectation of obedience (see GKC 317 &#167;107.<i>o</i>). As an additional way of looking at this line, U. Cassuto suggests that the verb is in the singular in order to say that they could not have even one other god, and the word &#8220;gods&#8221; is plural to include any gods (<i>Exodus</i>, 241).<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H312" data-lemma="H312">other</span>  <span class="w H430" data-lemma="H430">gods</span>  <span class="w H6440" data-lemma="H6440">before</span> me.<span class="note"><span class="key">8</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The expression <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1497;</font> (&#8217;<font face="Scholar">al-panay</font>) has several possible interpretations. S. R. Driver suggests &#8220;in front of me,&#8221; meaning obliging me to behold them, and also giving a prominence above me (<i>Exodus</i>, 193-94). W. F. Albright rendered it &#8220;You shall not prefer other gods to me&#8221; (<i>From the Stone Age to Christianity</i>, 297, n. 29). B. Jacob (<i>Exodus</i>, 546) illustrates it with marriage: the wife could belong to only one man while every other man was &#8220;another man.&#8221; They continued to exist but were not available to her. The point is clear from the Law, regardless of the specific way the prepositional phrase is rendered. God demands absolute allegiance, to the exclusion of all other deities. The preposition may imply some antagonism, for false gods would be opposed to Yahweh. U. Cassuto adds that God was in effect saying that anytime Israel turned to a false god they had to know that the Lord was there &#8211; it is always in his presence, or before him (<i>Exodus</i>, 241).<br /></span></span> </span>

The two could be taken as a hendiadys: &#8220;you will not prostrate yourself to serve them.&#8221; In an interesting side comment U. Cassuto (<i>Exodus</i>, 242) offers an explanation of the spelling of the second verb: he suggests that it was spelled with the <i>qamets khatuf</i> vowel to show contempt for pagan worship, as if their conduct does not even warrant a correct spelling of the word &#8220;serve.&#8221; Gesenius says that the forms like this are anomalous, but he wonders if they were pointed as if the verb was a Hophal with the meaning &#8220;you shall not allow yourself to be brought to worship them&#8221; (GKC 161 &#167;60.<i>b</i>). But this is unlikely.<br /></span></span> <span class="w H3588" data-lemma="H3588">for</span> <span class="w H595" data-lemma="H595">I</span>,  the <span class="w H3068" data-lemma="H3068">Lord</span>,  your <span class="w H430" data-lemma="H430">God</span>,  am a <span class="w H7067" data-lemma="H7067">jealous</span><span class="note"><span class="key">14</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> The word &#8220;jealous&#8221; is the same word often translated &#8220;zeal&#8221; or &#8220;zealous.&#8221; The word describes a passionate intensity to protect or defend something that is jeopardized. The word can also have the sense of &#8220;envy,&#8221; but in that case the object is out of bounds. God&#8217;s zeal or jealousy is to protect his people or his institutions or his honor.

Often rendered &#8220;visiting,&#8221; it might here be rendered &#8220;dealing with&#8221; in a negative sense or &#8220;punishing,&#8221; but it describes positive attention in <ref id="1887">13:19</ref>. When used of God, it essentially means that God intervenes in the lives of people for blessing or for cursing. Some would simply translate the participle here as &#8220;punishing&#8221; the children for the sins of the fathers (cf. <ref id="3277">Lev 18:25</ref>; <ref id="18152">Isa 26:21</ref>; <ref id="19668, 19874">Jer 29:32; 36:31</ref>; <ref id="22099">Hos 1:4</ref>; <ref id="22398">Amos 3:2</ref>). That is workable, but may not say enough. The verse may indicate that those who hate Yahweh and do not keep his commandments will repeat the sins their fathers committed and suffer for them. <ref id="5542">Deut 24:16</ref> says that individuals will die for their own sins and not their father&#8217;s sins (see also <ref id="5122">Deut 7:10</ref> and Ezek 18). It may have more to do with patterns of sin being repeated from generation to generation; if the sin and the guilt were not fully developed in the one generation, then left unchecked they would develop and continue in the next. But it may also indicate that the effects of the sins of the fathers will be experienced in the following generations, especially in the case of Israel as a national entity (U. Cassuto, <i>Exodus</i>, 243). God is showing here that his ethical character is displayed in how he deals with sin and righteousness, all of which he describes as giving strong motivation for loyalty to him and for avoiding idolatry. There is a justice at work in the dealings of God that is not present in the pagan world.<br /></span></span>  the <span class="w H5771" data-lemma="H5771">transgression</span> of <span class="w H1" data-lemma="H1">fathers</span> by dealing <span class="w H5921" data-lemma="H5921">with</span> <span class="w H1121" data-lemma="H1121">children</span> <span class="w H5921" data-lemma="H5921">to</span> the <span class="w H8029" data-lemma="H8029">third</span> and <span class="w H7256" data-lemma="H7256">fourth</span> <span class="t1">generations<span class="note"><span class="key">16</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The Hebrew word for &#8220;generations&#8221; is not found in <ref id="2057">v. 5</ref> or 6.

These are descendants from the righteous, and even associates with them, who benefit from the mercy that God extends to his people. S. R. Driver (<i>Exodus</i>, 195) says that this passage teaches that God&#8217;s mercy transcends his wrath; in his providence the beneficial consequences of a life of goodness extend indefinitely further than the retribution that is the penalty for persisting in sin. To say that God&#8217;s loyal love extends to thousands of generations or the thousandth generation is parallel to saying that it endures forever (Ps. 118).

There are all kinds of theories as to the origin of the day, most notably in the Babylonian world, but the differences are striking in so far as the pagan world had these days filled with magic. Nevertheless, the pagan world does bear witness to a tradition of a regular day set aside for special sacrifices. See, for example, H. W.

Verses 9 and 10 explain in part how this was to be done. To set this day apart as holy taught Israel the difference between the holy and the profane, that there was something higher than daily life. If an Israelite bent down to the ground laboring all week, the Sabbath called his attention to the heavens, to pattern life after the Creator (B.

It required Israel to cease from ordinary labors and devote the day to God. It required Israel to enter into the life of God, to share his Sabbath. It gave them a chance to recall the work of the Creator. But in the NT the apostolic teaching for the Church does not make one day holier than another, but calls for the entire life to be sanctified to God. This teaching is an application of the meaning of entering into the Sabbath of God. The book of Hebrews declares that those who believe in Christ cease from their works and enter into his Sabbath rest. For a Christian keeping Saturday holy is not a requirement from the NT; it may be a good and valuable thing to have a day of rest and refreshment, but it is not a binding law for the Church. The principle of setting aside time to worship and serve the Lord has been carried forward, but the strict regulations have not.<br /></span></span>   </span>

They, for the most part, are reiterated in the NT, in one way or another, usually with a much higher standard that requires attention to the spirit of the laws. Thus, these laws reveal God&#8217;s standard of righteousness by revealing sin. No wonder the Israelites were afraid when they saw the manifestation of God and heard his laws. When the whole covenant is considered, preamble and all, then it becomes clear that the motivation for obeying the commands is the person and the work of the covenant God &#8211; the one who redeemed his people. Obedience then becomes a response of devotion and adoration to the Redeemer who set them free. It becomes loyal service, not enslavement to laws. The point could be worded this way: God requires that his covenant people, whom he has redeemed, and to whom he has revealed himself, give their absolute allegiance and obedience to him. This means they will worship and serve him and safeguard the well-being of each other.<br /></span></span> </span>

It may be a musical direction of some kind.<br /></span></span>   </span>
<span class="verse Ps_3_3" data-osis="Ps.3.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>But <span class="w H859" data-lemma="H859">you</span>,  <span class="w H3068" data-lemma="H3068">Lord</span>,  are a <span class="w H4043" data-lemma="H4043">shield</span> <span class="w H1157" data-lemma="H1157">that protects me;</span><span class="note"><span class="key">7</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;a shield round about me.&#8221;<br /></span></span>   you are my <span class="w H3519" data-lemma="H3519">glory</span><span class="note"><span class="key">8</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;my glory,&#8221; or &#8220;my honor.&#8221; The psalmist affirms that the <sc>Lord</sc> is his source of honor, i.e., the one who gives him honor in the sight of others. According to BDB 459 s.v. II <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;</font> 7, the phrase refers to God as the one to whom the psalmist gives honor. But the immediate context focuses on what God does for the psalmist, not vice-versa.<br /></span></span>   and the one who <span class="w H7311" data-lemma="H7311">restores</span> me.<span class="note"><span class="key">9</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;[the one who] lifts my head.&#8221; This phrase could be understood to refer to a general strengthening of the psalmist by God during difficult circumstances. However, if one takes the suggestion of the superscription that this is a Davidic psalm written during the revolt of Absalom, the phrase &#8220;lift the head&#8221; could refer to the psalmist&#8217;s desire for restoration to his former position (cf. <ref id="1186">Gen 40:13</ref> where the same phrase is used). Like the Hebrew text, the present translation (&#8220;who restores me&#8221;) can be understood in either sense.<br /></span></span> </span>
<span class="verse Ps_3_4" data-osis="Ps.3.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="w H413" data-lemma="H413">To</span> the <span class="w H3069" data-lemma="H3069">Lord</span> I <span class="w H7121 H6963" data-lemma="H7121 H6963">cried out</span>,<span class="note"><span class="key">10</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The prefixed verbal form could be an imperfect, yielding the translation &#8220;I cry out,&#8221; but the verb form in the next line (a <i>vav</i> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>] consecutive with the preterite) suggests this is a brief narrative of what has already happened. Consequently the verb form in <ref id="13962">v. 4</ref>a is better understood as a preterite, &#8220;I cried out.&#8221; (For another example of the preterite of this same verb form, see <ref id="14328">Ps 30:8</ref>.) Sometime after the crisis arose, the psalmist prayed to the Lord and received an assuring answer. Now he confidently awaits the fulfillment of the divine promise.<br /></span></span>   and he <span class="w H6030" data-lemma="H6030">answered</span> me from his <span class="w H6944" data-lemma="H6944">holy</span> <span class="w H2022" data-lemma="H2022">hill</span>.<span class="note"><span class="key">11</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> <i>His holy hill</i>. That is, Zion (see <ref id="13952, 14636-14637">Pss 2:6; 48:1-2</ref>). The psalmist recognizes that the <sc>Lord</sc> dwells in his sanctuary on Mount Zion.<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H5542" data-lemma="H5542">(Selah)</span> </span>
<span class="verse Ps_3_5" data-osis="Ps.3.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="w H589" data-lemma="H589">I</span> <span class="w H7901" data-lemma="H7901">rested</span> and <span class="w H3462" data-lemma="H3462">slept;</span> I <span class="w H6974" data-lemma="H6974">awoke</span>,<span class="note"><span class="key">12</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The three verbal forms that appear in succession here (perfect + <i>vav</i> [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;</font>] consecutive with preterite + perfect) are most naturally taken as narrational. When the psalmist received an assuring word from the <sc>Lord</sc>, he was able to sleep calmly. Because the <sc>Lord</sc> was protecting him, he awoke safely from his sleep.<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H3588" data-lemma="H3588">for</span> the <span class="w H3068" data-lemma="H3068">Lord</span> <span class="w H5564" data-lemma="H5564">protects</span><span class="note"><span class="key">13</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;supports&#8221;; &#8220;sustains.&#8221; In this explanatory causal clause the imperfect verbal form probably has a habitual or present progressive nuance, for the psalmist is confident of God&#8217;s continual protection (see <ref id="13961">v. 3</ref>). Another option is to take the verb as a preterite, &#8220;for the <sc>Lord</sc> protected me.&#8221; In this case, the psalmist focuses specifically on the protection God provided while he slept.<br /></span></span>   me. </span>

Now, using the same verbal root (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;</font>, <font face="Scholar">qum</font>) he asks the <sc>Lord</sc> to rise up (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font>, <font face="Scholar">qumah</font>) in his defense.<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H3068" data-lemma="H3068">Lord!</span> <span class="w H3467" data-lemma="H3467">Deliver</span> me, my <span class="w H430" data-lemma="H430">God!</span> <span class="w H3588" data-lemma="H3588">Yes</span>,<span class="note"><span class="key">18</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> Elsewhere in the psalms the particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>), when collocated with a perfect verbal form and subordinated to a preceding imperative directed to God, almost always has an explanatory or causal force (&#8220;for, because&#8221;) and introduces a motivating argument for why God should respond positively to the request (see <ref id="13984, 13988, 14068, 14094, 14547, 14742, 14757, 14770, 14810, 14937, 15069, 15993, 16102, 16293, 16302">Pss 5:10; 6:2; 12:1; 16:1; 41:4; 55:9; 56:1; 57:1; 60:2; 69:1; 74:20; 119:94; 123:3; 142:6; 143:8</ref>). (On three occasions the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> is recitative after a verb of perception [&#8220;see/know that,&#8221; see <ref id="13969, 14271, 16058">Pss 4:3; 25:19; 119:159</ref>]). If <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> is taken as explanatory here, then the psalmist is arguing that God should deliver him now because that is what God characteristically does. However, such a motivating argument is not used in the passages cited above. The motivating argument usually focuses on the nature of the psalmist&#8217;s dilemma or the fact that he trusts in the Lord. For this reason it is unlikely that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> has its normal force here. Most scholars understand the particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> as having an asseverative (emphasizing) function here (&#8220;indeed, yes&#8221;; NEB leaves the particle untranslated).<br /></span></span>   you will <span class="w H5221" data-lemma="H5221">strike</span><span class="note"><span class="key">19</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> If the particle <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> (<font face="Scholar">ki</font>) is taken as explanatory, then the perfect verbal forms in <ref id="13965">v. 7</ref>b would describe God&#8217;s characteristic behavior. However, as pointed out in the preceding note on the word &#8220;yes,&#8221; the particle probably has an asseverative force here. If so, the perfects may be taken as indicating rhetorically the psalmist&#8217;s certitude and confidence that God will intervene. The psalmist is so confident of God&#8217;s positive response to his prayer, he can describe God&#8217;s assault on his enemies as if it had already happened. Such confidence is consistent with the mood of the psalm, as expressed before (<ref id="13961-13964">vv. 3-6</ref>) and after this (<ref id="13966">v. 8</ref>). Another option is to take the perfects as precative, expressing a wish or request (&#8220;Strike all my enemies on the jaw, break the teeth of the wicked&#8221;). See <i>IBHS</i> 494-95 &#167;30.5.4c, d. However, not all grammarians are convinced that the perfect is used as a precative in biblical Hebrew.<br /></span></span>    <span class="w H3605" data-lemma="H3605">all</span> my <span class="w H341" data-lemma="H341">enemies</span> on the <span class="w H3895" data-lemma="H3895">jaw;</span> you will <span class="w H7665" data-lemma="H7665">break</span> the <span class="w H8127" data-lemma="H8127">teeth</span><span class="note"><span class="key">20</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> The expression <i>break the teeth</i> may envision violent hand-to hand combat, though it is possible that the enemies are pictured here as a dangerous animal (see <ref id="13550">Job 29:17</ref>).<br /></span></span>   of the <span class="w H7563" data-lemma="H7563">wicked</span>.<span class="note"><span class="key">21</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> In the psalms the Hebrew term <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1512;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">r&#255;sha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">im</font>, &#8220;wicked&#8221;) describes people who are proud, practical atheists (<ref id="14044, 14046, 14053">Ps 10:2, 4, 11</ref>) who hate God&#8217;s commands, commit sinful deeds, speak lies and slander (<ref id="14685-14689">Ps 50:16-20</ref>), and cheat others (<ref id="14472">Ps 37:21</ref>).

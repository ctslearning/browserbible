<h3>Jehoiakim Burns the Scroll Containing the Lord's Messages</h3>

Necho had installed him as puppet king in place of his brother Jehoahaz who was deposed by Necho after a reign of only three months (<ref id="10197-10201">2 Kgs 23:31-35</ref>). According to <ref id="20048">Jer 46:2</ref> that was the year in which Nebuchadnezzar defeated Jehoiakim&#8217;s suzerain Necho at Carchemish. That was also the same year that Jerusalem came under attack and submitted to Babylonian control after a brief siege (<ref id="21739">Dan 1:1</ref>; see the study note on <ref id="19536">25:1</ref> for the reason for the difference in the dating between <ref id="19536, 19845">Jer 25:1; 36:2</ref> and <ref id="21739">Dan 1:1</ref>). These events confirmed what Jeremiah had been saying about the foe from the north (<ref id="19034, 19091, 19328">4:6; 6:1; 15:12</ref>) and would have provided the impetus for the hopes that the people would repent if they were reminded about what Jeremiah had been saying.<br /></span></span>   that <span class="w H3079" data-lemma="H3079">Jehoiakim</span> <span class="w H1121" data-lemma="H1121">son</span> of <span class="w H2977" data-lemma="H2977">Josiah</span> was <span class="w H4428" data-lemma="H4428">ruling</span> over <span class="w H3063" data-lemma="H3063">Judah</span>.<span class="note"><span class="key">2</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;This word came to Jeremiah from the <sc>Lord</sc> in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah the king of Judah, saying.&#8221;<br /></span></span>   </span>

The exact content of this scroll is unknown since many of the messages in the present book are undated. It is also not known what relation this scroll had to the present form of the book of Jeremiah, since this scroll was destroyed and another one written that contained more than this one did (cf. <ref id="19875">v. 32</ref>). Since Jeremiah continued his ministry down to the fall of Jerusalem in 587/6 <sc>b.c.</sc> (<ref id="18949">1:2</ref>) and beyond (cf.

However, that occurred only later during the tenth year of Zedekiah (<ref id="19733-19734">Jer 32:1-2</ref>) and Jeremiah appears here to be free to come and go as he pleased (<ref id="19862">vv. 19</ref>, 26). The word is used in the active voice of the <sc>Lord</sc> preventing Sarah from having a baby (<ref id="384">Gen 16:2</ref>). The probable nuance is here &#8220;I am prevented/ debarred&#8221; from being able to go. No reason is given why he was prevented/debarred. It has been plausibly suggested that he was prohibited from going into the temple any longer because of the scathing sermon he delivered there earlier (<ref id="19574-19576, 19121-19135">Jer 26:1-3; 7:1-15</ref>).<br /></span></span>   into the <span class="w H3068" data-lemma="H3068">Lord’s</span> <span class="w H1004" data-lemma="H1004">temple</span>.  </span>

Rather fast days were called on special occasions, i.e., in times of drought or a locust plague (<ref id="22306, 22327">Joel 1:14; 2:15</ref>), or during a military crisis (<ref id="11591">2 Chr 20:3</ref>), or after defeat in battle (<ref id="8023">1 Sam 31:13</ref>; <ref id="8035">2 Sam 1:12</ref>). A fast day was likely chosen for the reading of the scroll because the people would be more mindful of the crisis they were in and be in more of a repentant mood. The events referred to in the study note on <ref id="19844">v. 1</ref> would have provided the basis for Jeremiah&#8217;s anticipation of a fast day when the scroll could be read.<br /></span></span>   in the <span class="w H3068" data-lemma="H3068">Lord’s</span>  <span class="w H1004" data-lemma="H1004">temple</span>.  <span class="w H7121" data-lemma="H7121">Read</span> out loud where all of them can hear you what I <span class="w H1697" data-lemma="H1697">told</span> you the <span class="w H3068" data-lemma="H3068">Lord</span> <span class="w H6310" data-lemma="H6310">said</span>,  <span class="w H834" data-lemma="H834">which</span> you <span class="w H3789" data-lemma="H3789">wrote</span> in the <span class="w H4039" data-lemma="H4039">scroll</span>.<span class="note"><span class="key">11</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;So you go and read from the scroll which you have written from my mouth the words of the <sc>Lord</sc> in the ears of the people in the house of the <sc>Lord</sc> on a fast day, and in that way [for the explanation of this rendering see below] you will be reading them in the ears of all Judah [= the people of Judah] who come from their towns [i.e., to the temple to fast].&#8221; Again the syntax of the original is awkward, separating several of the qualifying phrases from the word or phrase they are intended to modify. In most of the &#8220;literal&#8221; English versions the emphasis on &#8220;what the <sc>Lord</sc> said&#8221; tends to get lost and it looks like two separate groups are to be addressed rather than one. The intent of the phrase is to define who the people are who will hear; the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;</font> that introduces the clause is explicative (BDB 252 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1493;&#1463;</font> 1.b) and the <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">gam</font>) is used to emphasize the explicative &#8220;all Judah who come in from their towns&#8221; (cf. BDB 169 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1501;</font> 2). If some force were to be given to the &#8220;literal&#8221; rendering of that particle here it would be &#8220;actually.&#8221; This is the group that is to be addressed according to <ref id="19846">v. 3</ref>. The complex Hebrew sentence has been restructured to include all the relevant information in more comprehensible and shorter English sentences.<br /></span></span>    </span>

Hence many see these words as the object of the verb which has an impersonal subject &#8220;they.&#8221; This is most likely unless with J. Bright (<i>Jeremiah</i> [AB], 180) the word &#8220;proclaim&#8221; is used in a looser sense as &#8220;observed.&#8221; The translation has chosen to follow this latter tack rather than use the impersonal (or an equivalent passive) construction in English. For a similar problem see <ref id="22564">Jonah 3:5</ref> which precedes the official proclamation in 3:7. The Hebrew text reads: &#8220;In the fifth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, in the ninth month they proclaimed a fast before the <sc>Lord</sc>, all the people in Jerusalem and all the people who came from the cities of Judah into Jerusalem.&#8221; The sentence has been broken down and restructured to better conform with contemporary English style.<br /><br/></br><b>sn</b> Judging from <ref id="19865">v. 22</ref> this was one of the winter months meaning that the reckoning is based on the calendar which starts with April rather than the one which starts with September (Nisan to Nisan rather than Tishri to Tishri). The ninth month would have been Kislev which corresponds roughly to December. According to Babylonian historical records this is the same year and the same month when Ashkelon was captured and sacked. The surrender of Jerusalem and the subsequent looting of the temple in the previous year (<ref id="21739">Dan 1:1</ref>) and the return of the menacing presence of Nebuchadnezzar in the near vicinity were probably the impetus for the fast.<br /></span></span>   </span>

The gerund &#8220;saying&#8221; that introduces &#8216;Why did you write&#8217; does not fit very well with &#8220;you burned the scroll.&#8221; Gerunds of this sort are normally explanatory. Lastly, there is no indication in the narrative that Jehoiakim ever directly asked Jeremiah this question. In fact, he had been hidden out of sight so Jehoiakim couldn&#8217;t confront him. The question is presented rhetorically, expressing Jehoiakim&#8217;s thoughts or intents and giving the rational for burning the scroll, i.e., he questioned Jeremiah&#8217;s right to say such things. The translation has attempted to be as literal as possible without resolving some of these difficulties. One level of embedded quotes has been eliminated for greater simplicity.

It also uses the words &#8220;everything&#8221; for &#8220;all the words&#8221; and &#8220;messages&#8221; for &#8220;words&#8221; because those are legitimate usages of these phrases, and they avoid the mistaken impression that Jeremiah repeated verbatim the words on the former scroll or repeated verbatim the messages that he had delivered during the course of the preceding twenty-three years.<br /></span></span> </span>

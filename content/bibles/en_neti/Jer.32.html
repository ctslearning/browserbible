The background is significant because it shows that Jeremiah was predicting the fall of the city and the kingdom and was being held prisoner for doing so. Despite this pessimistic outlook, the <sc>Lord</sc> wanted Jeremiah to demonstrate his assurance of the future restoration (which has been the topic of the two preceding chapters) by buying a field as a symbolic act that the Israelites would again one day regain possession of their houses, fields, and vineyards (<ref id="19747">vv. 15</ref>, 44).

It had been interrupted while the Babylonian army was occupied with fighting against an Egyptian force that had invaded Judah. During this period of relaxed siege Jeremiah had attempted to go to his home town in Anathoth to settle some property matters, had been accused of treason, and been thrown into a dungeon (<ref id="19886-19890">37:11-15</ref>). After appealing to Zedekiah he had been moved from the dungeon to the courtyard of the guardhouse connected to the palace (<ref id="19896">37:21</ref>) where he remained confined until Jerusalem was captured in 587/86 <sc>b.c.</sc> (<ref id="19924">38:28</ref>).<br /><br/></br><b>map</b> For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.<br /></span></span>   The <span class="w H5030" data-lemma="H5030">prophet</span> <span class="w H3414" data-lemma="H3414">Jeremiah</span> <span class="w H1961" data-lemma="H1961">was</span> <span class="w H3607" data-lemma="H3607">confined</span> in the <span class="w H2691" data-lemma="H2691">courtyard</span> of the <span class="w H4307" data-lemma="H4307">guardhouse</span><span class="note"><span class="key">4</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the courtyard of the guarding&#8221; or &#8220;place of guarding.&#8221; This expression occurs only in the book of Jeremiah (<ref id="19734, 19740, 19744, 19777, 19896, 19902, 19908, 19924, 19938, 19939">32:2, 8, 12; 33:1; 37:21; 38:6, 12, 28; 39:14, 15</ref>) and in <ref id="12353">Neh 3:25</ref>. It is not the same as an enclosed prison which is where Jeremiah was initially confined (<ref id="19890-19891">37:15-16</ref>; literally a &#8220;house of imprisoning&#8221; [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1514; &#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</font>, <font face="Scholar">bet ha</font>&#8217;<font face="Scholar">esur</font>] or &#8220;house of confining&#8221; [<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1514; &#1492;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1462;&#1500;&#1462;&#1488;</font>, <font face="Scholar">bet hakkele</font>&#8217;]). It is said to have been in the palace compound (<ref id="19734">32:2</ref>) near the citadel or upper palace (<ref id="12353">Neh 3:25</ref>). Though it was a place of confinement (<ref id="19734, 19777, 19939">32:2; 33:1; 39:15</ref>) Jeremiah was able to receive visitors, e.g., his cousin Hanamel (<ref id="19740">32:8</ref>) and the scribe Baruch (<ref id="19744">32:12</ref>), and conduct business there (<ref id="19744">32:12</ref>). According to <ref id="19744">32:12</ref> other Judeans were also housed there. A cistern of one of the royal princes, Malkijah, was located in this courtyard, so this is probably not a &#8220;prison compound&#8221; as NJPS interpret but a courtyard adjacent to a guardhouse or guard post (so G. L. Keown, P. J. Scalise, T. G. Smothers, <i>Jeremiah 26-52</i> [WBC], 151, and compare <ref id="12664">Neh 12:39</ref> where reference is made to a Gate of the Guard/Guardhouse) used here for housing political prisoners who did not deserve death or solitary confinement as some of the officials though Jeremiah did.<br /></span></span>   attached to the <span class="w H4428" data-lemma="H4428">royal</span>  <span class="w H1004" data-lemma="H1004">palace</span> of <span class="w H3063" data-lemma="H3063">Judah</span>.  </span>

W. Bullinger (<i>Figures of Speech</i>, 953-54) calls a rhetorical question of expostulation or remonstrance (cf. the note on <ref id="19582">26:9</ref> and compare also the question in <ref id="19872">36:29</ref>. In all three of these cases NJPS translates &#8220;How dare you&#8230;&#8221; which captures the force nicely). The Hebrew text reads, &#8220;For Zedekiah king of Judah had confined him, saying, &#8216;Why are you prophesying, saying, &#8220;Thus says the <sc>Lord</sc>, &#8216;Behold I am giving this city into the hands of the king of Babylon and he will capture it.&#8217;&#8221;&#8217;&#8221;<br /></span></span> </span>

Under these laws, if a property owner became impoverished and had to sell his land, the nearest male relative had the right and duty to buy it so that it would not pass out of the use of the extended family. The land, however, would not actually belong to Jeremiah because in the year of Jubilee it reverted to its original owner. All Jeremiah was actually buying was the right to use it (<ref id="3483-3487">Lev 25:13-17</ref>). Buying the field, thus, did not make any sense (thus Jeremiah&#8217;s complaint in <ref id="19757">v. 25</ref>) other than the fact that the <sc>Lord</sc> intended to use Jeremiah&#8217;s act as a symbol of a restored future in the land.<br /></span></span> </span>

The sentence is broken up in accordance with contemporary English style. The reference to the &#8220;deed of purchase&#8221; in <ref id="19744">v. 12</ref> should be viewed as a plural consisting of both written and sealed copies as is clear from <ref id="19743">v. 11</ref> and also <ref id="19746">v. 14</ref>. Part of the confusion is due to the nature of this document which consisted of a single papyrus scroll, half of which was rolled up and sealed and the other half which was left &#8220;opened&#8221; or unsealed. J. Bright (<i>Jeremiah</i> [AB], 237-38) is probably incorrect in assuming that the copies were duplicate since the qualification &#8220;containing the order of transfer and the regulations&#8221; is only applied to the appositional participle, &#8220;the sealed one [or copy].&#8221;<br /><br/></br><b>sn</b> Aramaic documents from a slightly later period help us understand the nature of such deeds.

The other copy consisted of an abstract and was left loosely rolled and unsealed (i.e., open to be consulted at will).

The Hebrew text reads: &#8220;you did miracles and marvelous acts in the land of Egypt until this day and in Israel and in mankind and you made for yourself a name as this day.&#8221; The majority of English versions and commentaries understand the phrases &#8220;until this day and in Israel and in mankind&#8221; to be an elliptical sentence with the preceding verb and objects supplied as reflected in the alternate translation. However, the emphasis on the miraculous deeds in Egypt in this section both before and after this elliptical phrase and the dominant usage of the terms &#8220;signs and wonders&#8221; to refer to the plagues and other miraculous signs in Egypt calls this interpretation into question. The key here is understanding &#8220;both in Israel and in mankind&#8221; as an example of a <i>casus pendens</i> construction (a dangling subject, object, or other modifier) before a conjunction introducing the main clause (cf. GKC 327 &#167;111.<i>h</i> and 458 &#167;143.<i>d</i> and compare the usage in <ref id="19109, 19800">Jer 6:19; 33:24</ref>; <ref id="9263">1 Kgs 15:13</ref>).

The structure of the two introductions in <ref id="19760">v. 28</ref> and <ref id="19768">v. 36</ref> are parallel and flow out of the statement that the <sc>Lord</sc> is God of all mankind and nothing is too hard for him (neither destruction nor restoration [cf. <ref id="18957">1:10</ref>]).<br /></span></span>   But <span class="w H6258" data-lemma="H6258">now</span> <span class="w H3651" data-lemma="H3651">I</span>,  the <span class="w H3068" data-lemma="H3068">Lord</span> <span class="w H430" data-lemma="H430">God</span> of <span class="w H3478" data-lemma="H3478">Israel</span>,  have something further <span class="w H413" data-lemma="H413">to</span> say about <span class="w H2063" data-lemma="H2063">this</span> <span class="w H5892" data-lemma="H5892">city:</span><span class="note"><span class="key">78</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;And now therefore thus says the <sc>Lord</sc>, the God of Israel, concerning this city which you [masc. pl.] are saying has been given [prophetic perfect = will be given] into the hand of the king of Babylon through sword, starvation, and disease.&#8221; The translation attempts to render the broader structure mentioned in the study note and to break the sentence down in a way that conforms more to contemporary English style and that will lead into the speech which does not begin until the next verse. As in <ref id="19760">v. 28</ref> the third person introduction has been changed to first person for smoother narrative style in a first person speech (i.e., <ref id="19739-19776">vv. 27-44</ref> are all the <sc>Lord</sc>&#8217;s answer to Jeremiah&#8217;s prayer). The words &#8220;right in&#8221; added to &#8220;are saying&#8221; are intended to reflect the connection between <ref id="19760">v. 28</ref> and the statement here (which is a repetition of <ref id="19756">v. 24</ref>). I.e., God does not deny that Jeremiah&#8217;s assessment is correct; he affirms it but has something further to say in answer to Jeremiah&#8217;s prayer.<br /></span></span>   </span>

And <ref id="19725">Jer 31:33</ref> speaks of God writing his law on their hearts.

The new covenant appears to be similar to the ancient Near Eastern covenants of grants whereby a great king gave a loyal vassal a grant of land or dynastic dominion over a realm in perpetuity in recognition of past loyalty. The right to such was perpetual as long as the great king exercised dominion, but the actual enjoyment could be forfeited by individual members of the vassal&#8217;s dynasty. The best example of such an covenant in the OT is the Davidic covenant where the dynasty was given perpetual right to rule over Israel. Individual kings might be disciplined and their right to enjoy dominion taken away, but the dynasty still maintained the right to rule (see <ref id="8659">2 Sam 23:5</ref>; <ref id="15353-15364">Ps 89:26-37</ref> and note especially <ref id="9132-9148">1 Kgs 11:23-39</ref>). The new covenant appears to be the renewal of God&#8217;s promise to Abraham to always be the God of his descendants and for his descendants to be his special people (<ref id="405">Gen 17:7</ref>) something they appear to have forfeited by their disobedience (see <ref id="22104">Hos 1:9</ref>). However, under the new covenant he promises to never stop doing them good and grants them a new heart, a new spirit, the infusion of his own spirit, and the love and reverence necessary to keep from turning away from him. The new covenant is not based on their past loyalty but on his gracious forgiveness and his gifts.<br /></span></span>   with them <span class="w H834" data-lemma="H834">that</span> I will <span class="w H3808" data-lemma="H3808">never</span> <span class="w H7725" data-lemma="H7725">stop doing</span> <span class="w H3190" data-lemma="H3190">good</span> <span class="w H310" data-lemma="H310">to</span> them.<span class="note"><span class="key">83</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;stop being gracious to them&#8221; or &#8220;stop blessing them with good&#8221;; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;turn back from them to do good to them.&#8221;<br /></span></span>  I will <span class="w H5414" data-lemma="H5414">fill</span> their <span class="w H3824" data-lemma="H3824">hearts</span> and <span class="t1">minds</span> with <span class="w H3374" data-lemma="H3374">respect</span> for me so that<span class="note"><span class="key">84</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> Or &#8220;I will make them want to fear and respect me so much that&#8221;; <i>Heb</i> &#8220;I will put the fear of me in their hearts.&#8221; However, as has been noted several times, &#8220;heart&#8221; in Hebrew is more the center of the volition (and intellect) than the center of emotions as it is in English.

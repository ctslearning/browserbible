But they are causing my people to be <span class="w H6" data-lemma="H6">destroyed</span> and <span class="w H6327" data-lemma="H6327">scattered</span>.<span class="note"><span class="key">3</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Woe to the shepherds who are killing and scattering the sheep of my pasture.&#8221; See the study note on <ref id="19468">22:13</ref> for the significance of &#8220;Sure to be judged&#8221; (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;Woe&#8221;) See the study note for the significance of the metaphor introduced here.<br /><br/></br><b>sn</b> Verses 1-4 of ch. 23 are an extended metaphor in which the rulers are compared to shepherds and the people are compared to sheep. This metaphor has already been met with in <ref id="19223">10:21</ref> and is found elsewhere in the context of the <sc>Lord</sc>&#8217;s covenant with David (cf. <ref id="8188-8189">2 Sam 7:7-8</ref>; <ref id="15184-15186">Ps 78:70-72</ref>). The sheep are God&#8217;s people and he is the ultimate shepherd who is personally concerned about their care (cf. <ref id="14237, 15201">Pss 23:1; 80:2</ref>). He has set rulers over them as his under-shepherds and they are responsible to him for the care of his sheep (see <ref id="19458-19459">22:3-4</ref>). They have been lax shepherds, allowing the sheep to be scattered and destroyed. So he will punish them. As the true shepherd of Israel he will regather his scattered flock and place new shepherds (rulers) over them. These verses lead to a promise of an ideal ruler set over an Israel which has experienced a new and better Exodus (<ref id="19491-19493">vv. 6-8</ref>). For a more complete development of this metaphor with similar messianic and eschatological implications see Ezek 34. The metaphor has been interpreted in the translation but some of the flavor left in the simile.<br /></span></span>   </span>

Though there were periodic kings like Josiah who did fulfill the ideals set forth in <ref id="19458">Jer 22:3</ref> (see <ref id="19470">Jer 22:15</ref>), by and large they were more like Jehoiakim who did not (see <ref id="19468">Jer 22:13</ref>). Hence the <sc>Lord</sc> brought to an end the Davidic rule. The potential for the ideal, however, remained because of God&#8217;s promise to David (<ref id="8197">2 Sam 7:16</ref>). The Davidic line became like a tree which was cut down, leaving only a stump. But from that stump God would bring forth a &#8220;shoot,&#8221; a &#8220;sprig&#8221; which would fulfill the ideals of kingship. See <ref id="17886-17891">Isa 11:1-6</ref> and <ref id="22921, 22960">Zech 3:8; 6:12</ref> for this metaphor and compare <ref id="21852-21853, 21861, 21864">Dan 4:14-15, 23, 26</ref> for a different but related use of the metaphor.<br /></span></span>   a descendant of <span class="w H1732" data-lemma="H1732">David</span>.

For the nuance of the verb &#8220;act wisely&#8221; rather than &#8220;prosper&#8221; see <ref id="22437">Amos 5:13</ref>; <ref id="13956">Ps 2:10</ref> (cf.

The ideal king would follow in the footsteps of his illustrious ancestor David (<ref id="8225">2 Sam 8:15</ref>) who set this forth as an ideal for his dynasty (<ref id="8657">2 Sam 23:3</ref>) and prayed for it to be true of his son Solomon (<ref id="15002-15003">Ps 72:1-2</ref>).<br /></span></span>   </span>

Here it probably sums up the justice that the <sc>Lord</sc> provides through raising up this ruler as well as the safety, security, and well-being that result (see <ref id="19490-19491">vv. 5-6</ref>a).

This almost assures that the reference to &#8220;walking in lies&#8221; (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;in the lie&#8221;) is referring to false prophesy. Moreover the references to the prophets in <ref id="19072">5:13</ref> and in <ref id="19307-19309">14:13-15</ref> are all in the context of false prophesy as are the following references in this chapter in <ref id="19509, 19511, 19517">23:24, 26, 32</ref> and in <ref id="19634">28:15</ref>.

Like Amos who focuses attention on the sins of the surrounding nations to bring out more forcefully the heinousness of Israel&#8217;s sin, God focuses attention on the sins of the prophets of Samaria to bring out the even worse sin of the prophets of Jerusalem. (The oracle is directed at them, not at the prophets of Samaria. See the announcement of judgment that follows.)

Moreover, Baal was worshiped in local manifestations as the Baal of Peor, Baal of Gad, etc. Hence, Baal is sometimes spoken of in the singular and sometimes in the plural. The <sc>Lord</sc> is the one true God (<ref id="5091">Deut 6:4</ref>). Moreover, he is the maker of heaven and earth (<ref id="349">Gen 14:12</ref>; <ref id="10077">2 Kgs 19:15</ref>; <ref id="15846">Ps 115:15</ref>), sees into the hearts of all men (<ref id="14380-14382">Ps 33:13-15</ref>), and judges men according to what they do (<ref id="20581, 20585, 20605">Ezek 7:3, 7, 27</ref>). There is no hiding from him (<ref id="13706">Job 34:22</ref>; <ref id="16247-16252">Ps 139:7-12</ref>) and no escape from his judgment (<ref id="22498-22500">Amos 9:2-4</ref>). God has already spoken to the people and their leaders through Jeremiah along these lines (<ref id="19354, 19455">Jer 16:17; 21:14</ref>).

The meaning of <ref id="19488-19525">vv. 33-40</ref> are debated because of (1) the ambiguity involved in the word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;</font> (<font face="Scholar">masa</font>&#8217;), which can mean either &#8220;burden&#8221; (as something carried or weighing heavily on a person; see, e.g., <ref id="2150">Exod 23:5</ref>; <ref id="3771">Num 4:27</ref>; <ref id="8423">2 Sam 15:33</ref>; <ref id="14495">Ps 38:4</ref>) or &#8220;oracle&#8221; (of doom; see, e. g., <ref id="17908">Isa 13:1</ref>; <ref id="22686">Nah 1:1</ref>); (the translation is debated due to etymological concerns), (2) the ambiguity of the line in <ref id="19521">v. 36</ref> which has been rendered &#8220;For what is &#8216;burdensome&#8217; really pertains rather to what a person himself says&#8221; (<i>Heb</i> &#8220;the burden is to the man his word&#8221;), and (3) the text in v. 33 of &#8220;you are the burden.&#8221; Many commentaries see a wordplay on the two words &#8220;burden&#8221; and &#8220;oracle&#8221; which are homonyms. However, from the contrasts that are drawn in the passage, it is doubtful whether the nuance of &#8220;oracle&#8221; ever is in view. The word is always used in the prophets of an oracle of doom or judgment; it is not merely revelation of God which one of the common people would have been uttering (contra NIV). Jeremiah never uses the word in that sense nor does anyone else in the book of Jeremiah.<br /><br/></br><b>sn</b> What is in view here is the idea that the people consider Jeremiah&#8217;s views of loyalty to God and obedience to the covenant &#8220;burdensome.&#8221; I.e., what burdensome demands is the <sc>Lord</sc> asking you to impose on us (See <ref id="19379, 19380, 19382, 19385">Jer 17:21, 22, 24, 27</ref> where this same word is used regarding Sabbath observance which they chafed at). The <sc>Lord</sc> answers back that it is not he who is being burdensome to them; they are burdensome to him (See <ref id="19322">15:6</ref>: &#8220;I am weary&#8221; and compare <ref id="17669">Isa 1:14</ref> where the verb rather than the noun is used).<br /></span></span> </span> do you have from the Lord?’ <span class="t1">Tell</span> them, ‘You are the <span class="w H4853" data-lemma="H4853">burden</span>,<span class="note"><span class="key">97</span><span class="text"><b>tc</b> The translation follows the Latin and Greek versions. The Hebrew text reads &#8220;What burden [i.e., burdensome message]?&#8221; The syntax of &#8220;what message?&#8221; is not in itself objectionable; the interrogative can function as an adjective (cf. BDB 552 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</font> 1.a[a]). What is objectionable to virtually all the commentaries and lexicons is the unparalleled use of the accusative particle in front of the interrogative and the noun (see, e.g., BDB 672 s.v.

This also makes a much more natural connection for the <i>vav</i> consecutive perfect that follows (cf.

For the major options and the issues involved W. L. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah</i> (Hermeneia), <ref id="1-1">1:651-52</ref> should be consulted. Most of them are excluded by the observation that <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1502;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;</font> probably does not mean &#8220;oracle&#8221; anywhere in this passage (see note on <ref id="19518">v. 33</ref> regarding the use of this word).

McKane, <i>Jeremiah</i> [ICC], <ref id="1-1">1:600-601</ref>). The latter is also ruled out by the fact that the antecedent of &#8220;his&#8221; on &#8220;his word&#8221; is clearly the word &#8220;man&#8221; in front of it. This would be the only case where the phrase &#8220;man of his word&#8221; occurs.

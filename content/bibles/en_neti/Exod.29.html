<h3>The Consecration of Aaron and His Sons</h3>

<span class="verse Exod_29_1" data-osis="Exod.29.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>“Now<span class="note"><span class="key">1</span><span class="text"><b>sn</b> Chap. 29 is a rather long, involved discussion of the consecration of Aaron the priest. It is similar to the ordination service in Lev 8. In fact, the execution of what is instructed here is narrated there. But these instructions must have been formulated after or in conjunction with Lev 1-7, for they presuppose a knowledge of the sacrifices. The bulk of the chapter is the consecration of the priests: 1-35. It has the preparation (1-3), washing (4), investiture and anointing (5-9), sin offering (10-14), burnt offering (15-18), installation peace offering (19-26, 31-34), other offerings&#8217; rulings (27-30), and the duration of the ritual (35). Then there is the consecration of the altar (36-37), and the oblations (38-46). There are many possibilities for the study and exposition of this material. The whole chapter is the consecration of tabernacle, altar, people, and most of all the priests. God was beginning the holy operations with sacral ritual. So the overall message would be: Everyone who ministers, everyone who worships, and everything they use in the presence of Yahweh, must be set apart to God by the cleansing, enabling, and sanctifying work of God.<br /></span></span> <span class="w H2088" data-lemma="H2088">this</span> is <span class="w H1697" data-lemma="H1697">what</span><span class="note"><span class="key">2</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;the thing.&#8221;<br /></span></span>   you are to <span class="w H6213" data-lemma="H6213">do</span> for them to <span class="w H6942" data-lemma="H6942">consecrate</span> them so that they may minister as my <span class="w H3547" data-lemma="H3547">priests</span>.   <span class="w H3947" data-lemma="H3947">Take</span> <span class="w H259" data-lemma="H259">a</span> <span class="w H1241 H1121" data-lemma="H1241 H1121">young</span><span class="note"><span class="key">3</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> Literally: &#8220;take one bull, a &#8216;son&#8217; of the herd.&#8221;<br /></span></span>   <span class="w H6499" data-lemma="H6499">bull</span> and <span class="w H8147" data-lemma="H8147">two</span> <span class="w H352" data-lemma="H352">rams</span> without <span class="w H8549" data-lemma="H8549">blemish;</span><span class="note"><span class="key">4</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> The word <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font> (<font face="Scholar">tamim</font>) means &#8220;perfect.&#8221; The animals could not have diseases or be crippled or blind (see Mal 1).

Oil of anointing was used for all major offices (giving the label with the passive adjective &#8220;<font face="Scholar">mashiah</font>&#8221; (or &#8220;messiah&#8221;) to anyone anointed. In the further revelation of Scripture, the oil came to signify the enablement as well as the setting apart, and often the Holy Spirit came on the person at the anointing with oil. The olive oil was a symbol of the Spirit in the OT as well (<ref id="22927-22929">Zech 4:4-6</ref>).

If a person touches the altar, he likewise becomes holy and cannot return to the profane regions. He will be given over to God to be dealt with as God pleases. Anyone who was not qualified to touch the altar did not dare approach it, for contact would have meant that he was no longer free to leave but was God&#8217;s holy possession &#8211; and might pay for it with his life (see <ref id="2412">Exod 30:29</ref>; <ref id="2868">Lev 6:18</ref>b, 27; and <ref id="21676">Ezek 46:20</ref>).<br /></span></span>    </span>

More technically, the first &#8220;evening&#8221; would be the time between sunset and the appearance of the crescent moon, and the second &#8220;evening&#8221; the next hour, or from the appearance of the crescent moon to full darkness (see <ref id="5349">Deut 16:6</ref> &#8211; &#8220;at the going down of the sun&#8221;). (2) Saadia, Rashi, and Kimchi say the first evening is when the sun begins to decline in the west and cast its shadows, and the second evening is the beginning of night. (3) The view adopted by the Pharisees and the Talmudists (<i>b. Pesahim</i> 61a) is that the first evening is when the heat of the sun begins to decrease, and the second evening begins at sunset, or, roughly from 3-5 <sc>p.m.</sc> The Mishnah (<i>m. Pesahim</i> <ref id="1634">5:1</ref>) indicates the lamb was killed about <ref id="99999">2:30</ref> <sc>p.m.</sc> &#8211; anything before noon was not valid. S. R. Driver concludes from this survey that the first view is probably the best, although the last view was the traditionally accepted one (<i>Exodus</i>, 89-90). Late afternoon or early evening seems to be intended, the time of twilight perhaps.<br /></span></span>   </span>

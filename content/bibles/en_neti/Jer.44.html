For the identification and location of Tahpanhes see the study note on <ref id="20005">Jer 43:7</ref>. The location of Migdol has been debated but is tentatively identified with a border fortress about twenty-five miles (42 km) east-northeast of Tahpanhes. The &#8220;region of southern Egypt&#8221; is literally &#8220;the land of Pathros,&#8221; the long Nile valley extending north and south between Cairo and Aswan (biblical Syene). For further information see the discussion in G. L. Keown, P. J. Scalise, T. G. Smothers, <i>Jeremiah 26-52</i> (WBC), 262-63. Reference here is to Judean exiles who had fled earlier as well as to those from Mizpah who were led into Egypt by Johanan and the other arrogant men (<ref id="20001, 20003">43:3, 5</ref>).<br /></span></span> </span> </span>

Another possible structure would be &#8220;None of the Judean remnant who have come to live in the land of Egypt will escape or survive. None of them will escape or survive to return to the land of Judah where they long to return to live. Indeed (emphatic use of <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> [<font face="Scholar">ki</font>]; cf. BDB 472 s.v. <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</font> 1.e) none of them shall return except a few fugitives.&#8221; This verse is a good example of rhetorical hyperbole where a universal negative does not apply to absolutely all the particulars. Though the <sc>Lord</sc> denies at the outset that any will escape or survive the punishment of <ref id="20013-20024">vv. 12-13</ref> to return to Judah, he says at the end that a few fugitives will return (the two words for fugitive are from the same root and mean the same thing). (E. W. Bullinger, <i>Figures of Speech</i>, 618-19, might classify this as a synecdoche of genus where a universal negative does not deny particularity.) That this last statement is not a gloss or an afterthought is supported by what is said later in <ref id="20039">v. 28</ref>.<br /></span></span>    </span>

What is interpretive is the assumption that the &#8220;and all the people who were living in Egypt in Pathros&#8221; is explicative of &#8220;the great crowd&#8221; and that the phrase &#8220;in Pathros&#8221; is conjunctive and not appositional. Several commentaries and English versions (e.g., J. A. Thompson, <i>Jeremiah</i> [NICOT], 678-79, n. 2; NJPS) assume that the phrase is descriptive of a second group, i.e., all the Jews from Pathros in Egypt (i.e., southern Egypt [see the study note on <ref id="20012">44:1</ref>]). Those who follow this interpretation generally see this as a gloss (see Thompson, 678, n. 2, and also W. L. Holladay, <i>Jeremiah</i> [Hermeneia], <ref id="99999">2:279</ref>, n. 15b). It is probably better to assume that the phrase is explicative and that &#8220;all&#8221; is used in the same rhetorical way that it has been used within the chapter, i.e., &#8220;all&#8221; = representatives of all. Likewise the phrase &#8220;in Pathros&#8221; should be assumed to be conjunctive as in the Syriac translation and as suggested by <i>BHS</i> fn c since Jeremiah&#8217;s answer in <ref id="20035">vv. 24</ref>, 26 is directed to all the Judeans living in Egypt.<br /></span></span>   They <span class="w H559" data-lemma="H559">answered</span>,  </span>

Three of the main verbs are second feminine plurals and one of them is second masculine plural. All the pronominal suffixes on the nouns are second masculine plurals.

Most all modern commentaries (e.g., J. A. Thompson, J. Bright, W. L. Holladay, and G. L. Keown, P. J. Scalise, T. G. Smothers) follow the reading of the Greek version which reads &#8220;you women&#8221; (= <i><font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492; &#1492;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</font></i>, [&#8217;<font face="Scholar">attenah hannashim</font>]) in place of &#8220;you and your wives&#8221; (<font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1488;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1462;&#1501; &#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1497;&#1499;&#1462;&#1501;</font>, &#8217;<font face="Scholar">attem un&#255;shekhem</font>) in the Hebrew. None of them, however, explain the use of the 2nd masc. plurals here. This is possibly a case where the masculine forms are used in the place of the feminine due to the dislike of Hebrew to use the feminine plural forms (cf. GKC 459 &#167;144.<i>a</i> and 466 &#167;145.<i>t</i>). This seems all the more probable when 2nd fem. pl. verbs are qualified by nouns with 2nd masc. pl. suffixes. The translation here follows this interpretation of the masc. pl. forms and reads &#8220;you women&#8221; with the Greek version in place of &#8220;you and your wives&#8221; and sees the referents throughout as the women.<br /></span></span>   have <span class="w H1696" data-lemma="H1696">confirmed</span> by your actions what you <span class="w H5088" data-lemma="H5088">vowed</span> with <span class="w H3027" data-lemma="H3027">your</span> <span class="w H6310" data-lemma="H6310">lips!</span> You <span class="w H559" data-lemma="H559">said</span>,  “We will certainly <span class="w H6213" data-lemma="H6213">carry out</span> our <span class="w H5087" data-lemma="H5087">vows</span> to <span class="w H6999" data-lemma="H6999">sacrifice</span> and <span class="w H5258" data-lemma="H5258">pour out</span>  <span class="w H5262" data-lemma="H5262">drink offerings</span> to the <span class="w H4446" data-lemma="H4446">Queen</span> of <span class="w H8064" data-lemma="H8064">Heaven</span>.”  Well, then <span class="w H6965" data-lemma="H6965">fulfill</span> your <span class="w H5088" data-lemma="H5088">vows!</span> <span class="w H6213" data-lemma="H6213">Carry</span> them <span class="w H6213" data-lemma="H6213">out!’</span><span class="note"><span class="key">44</span><span class="text"><b>tn</b> <i>Heb</i> &#8220;Carry out your vows!&#8221;<br /><br/></br><b>sn</b> The commands here are, of course, sarcastic and not meant to be taken literally.<br /></span></span>    </span>

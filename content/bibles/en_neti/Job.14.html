Some commentators (H. H. Rowley and A. B.

E. Dhorme, (<i>Job</i>, 197) takes it to mean &#8220;engraved&#8221; as on stone; from a custom of inscribing decrees on tablets of stone he derives the meaning here of &#8220;decreed.&#8221; This, he argues, is parallel to the way <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1495;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1511;</font> (<font face="Scholar">khaqaq</font>, &#8220;engrave&#8221;) is used.

Several emend the text slightly to make it an imperative rather than an imperfect; this is then translated &#8220;and desist.&#8221; The expression &#8220;from him&#8221; must be added. Another suggestion that is far-fetched is that of P. J. Calderone (&#8220;CHDL-II in poetic texts,&#8221; <i>CBQ</i> 23 [1961]: 451-60) and D. W.

The derived noun &#8220;the weak&#8221; would be in direct contrast to &#8220;the mighty man.&#8221; In the transitive sense the verb means &#8220;to weaken; to defeat&#8221; (<ref id="1997">Exod 17:13</ref>); here it may have the sense of &#8220;be lifeless, unconscious, inanimate&#8221; (cf. E. Dhorme, <i>Job</i>, 199). Many commentators emend the text to <font face="Galaxie Unicode Hebrew">&#1497;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1500;&#1465;&#1507;</font> (<font face="Scholar">yakhalof</font>, &#8220;passes on; passes away&#8221;). A.

G. R. Driver connected it to Arabic <i>halasa</i>, &#8220;carry off suddenly&#8221; (&#8220;The Resurrection of Marine and Terrestrial Creatures,&#8221; <i>JSS</i> 7 [1962]: 12-22). But the basic idea of &#8220;be weak, powerless&#8221; is satisfactory in the text. H. H.

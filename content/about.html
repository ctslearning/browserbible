<h3 id="credits">Credits</h3>
The Scripture Study App is adapted from the <a href="http://digitalbiblesociety.com/about/projects.php#inScript">InScript Bible Browser</a>, which was <a href="http://bit.ly/zcSQoe">developed</a> by <a href="http://j.hn/">John Dyer</a> for the <a href="http://digitalbiblesociety.com/">Digital Bible Society</a> (DBS). This innovative project was generously <a href="https://github.com/digitalbiblesociety/browserbible/">released as open source</a> by DBS for the good of the church and for the further innovation of other developers. Building on the foundation of this project, Calvin Theological Seminary designed various enhancements and features to provide an even richer study experience. These adaptations were developed by <a href="http://rapiddg.com">Rapid Development Group</a>, which specializes in open source standards-based web applications. <!-- ReadMe link is https://github.com/digitalbiblesociety/browserbible/blob/master/README.md -->

<p>We are grateful to John Dyer and DBS for their innovation and generosity, to <a href="http://bible.org">Bible.org</a> for their generosity in providing the study notes, and to <a href="http://openscriptures.org">Open Scriptures</a> for the development of various key components of the original app.

<p>Like the source from which it is adapted, the Scripture Study App will be open source. We will publish the code on <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> at the completion of our beta phase.
